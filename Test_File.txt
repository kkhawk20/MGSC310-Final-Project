NEWARK, Calif., Nov. 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID), setting new standards for luxury electric experience with the Lucid
Air, winner of the 2023 World Luxury Car Award, today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2023. The earnings
presentation is available on its investor relations website (https://ir.lucidmotors.com).
Lucid reported Q3 revenue of $137.8 million on deliveries of 1,457 vehicles and produced 1,550 vehicles. The company is also adjusting its production
outlook for 2023 to 8,000 – 8,500 vehicles to prudently align with deliveries.
"We delivered on our commitments to complete the Lucid Air lineup on time with Pure RWD and Sapphire, transition general assembly to our Phase 2
factory in Arizona, and open our first plant in Saudi Arabia. We recognize we still have work to do on our customer journey and deliveries," said Peter
Rawlinson, Lucid's CEO & CTO. "Next week, we look forward to the world premiere of the Lucid Gravity, our amazing vehicle that will redefine the
electric SUV. Gravity remains on track to begin production in late 2024."
"We are seeing results from our targeted marketing approach, as the majority of new demand came from customers who had their first contact with
Lucid in the quarter," said Sherry House, Lucid's CFO. "We've also made progress with the cost control program we implemented in the first half of the
year and have identified further opportunities for 2024. We ended the third quarter with approximately $5.45 billion in liquidity, which we expect to lead
us to our next major milestone, Gravity production, and beyond, into 2025."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Business Metrics
Condensed consolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with US GAAP ("GAAP") as well as on a non-GAAP basis to
supplement our condensed consolidated financial results. Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow which
are discussed below.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss before (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation and
amortization, (5) change in fair value of common stock warrant liability, (6) stock-based compensation and (7) restructuring charges. Lucid believes
that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to Lucid's management and investors about Lucid's financial performance. Free Cash Flow is
defined as net cash used in operating activities less capital expenditures. Lucid believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to Lucid's
management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after necessary capital expenditures.
These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to Lucid's historical performance. Management believes that it is
useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non-GAAP information because management uses such information internally for its
operating, budgeting, and financial planning purposes. Management also believes that presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides
useful information to Lucid's investors regarding measures of our financial condition and results of operations that Lucid uses to run the business and
therefore allows investors to better understand Lucid's performance. However, these non-GAAP financial and key performance measures have
limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.
Non-GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial
information reported under GAAP when understanding Lucid's operating performance. In addition, other companies, including companies in Lucid's
industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their
performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of Lucid's non-GAAP financial measures and key performance measures as tools for
comparison. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial information is presented below.
