Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and statements on our earnings webcast contain “forward-looking statements”
within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, including but not limited to, statements regarding our financial outlook, product development
and related timing, distribution, and pricing, expected benefits of and applications for our software
platforms, business strategy, and plans (including strategy and plans relating to our Artificial
Intelligence Platform (“AIP”), sales and marketing efforts, sales force, partnerships, and customers),
investments in our business, market trends and market size, opportunities (including growth
opportunities), our expectations regarding our existing and potential investments in, and commercial
contracts with, various entities, our expectations regarding macroeconomic events and foreign
currency fluctuations, and positioning. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date
they were first issued and were based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections
as well as the beliefs and assumptions of management. Words such as “guidance,” “expect,”
“anticipate,” “should,” “believe,” “hope,” “target,” “project,” “plan,” “goals,” “estimate,” “potential,”
“predict,” “may,” “will,” “might,” “could,” “intend,” “shall,” and variations of these terms or the negative
of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements.
Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which
involve factors or circumstances that are beyond our control. Our actual results could differ
materially from those stated or implied in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors,
including but not limited to risks detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”), including in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2022 and other filings and reports that we may file from time to time with the SEC, including our
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023. In particular, the following
factors, among others, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by
such forward-looking statements: our ability to successfully execute our business and growth
strategy; the sufficiency of our cash and cash equivalents to meet our liquidity needs; the demand
for our platforms, product offerings, and services in general; our ability to increase our number of new
customers and revenue generated from customers; our ability to realize some or all of the total
contract value of customer contracts as revenue, including any contractual options available to
customers or contractual periods that are subject to termination for convenience provisions; our long
and unpredictable sales cycle; our ability to successfully execute our channel sales and other
strategic initiatives with third parties; our ability to retain and expand our customer base; the
fluctuation of our results of operations and our key business measures on a quarterly basis in future
periods; the seasonality of our business; the implementation process for our platforms, which may
be complex and lengthy; our ability to successfully develop and deploy new technologies to address
the needs of our existing or prospective customers; our ability to make our platforms and product
offerings easier to install, consume, and use; our ability to maintain and enhance our brand and
reputation; our ability to maintain and enhance our culture as our business grows and as we pursue
our business and financial goals; news or social media coverage about us, including but not limited
to coverage that presents, or relies on, inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, or otherwise damaging
information; the impact of recent or future global macroeconomic and geopolitical events, such as
the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising inflation and interest rates in the U.S. and in other
countries, monetary policy changes, financial services sector instability, and foreign currency
fluctuations, on the business and operations of our company or of our existing or prospective
customers and partners; and any breach or access to customer or third-party data.
The forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views as of the date of
this press release. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to
change. We undertake no intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking statements
should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this
press release. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
Additional Definitions
For the purpose of this press release and our earnings webcast, total contract value (“TCV”) closed,
remaining performance obligations, and total remaining deal value reflect the values of contracts
that have been entered into with, or awarded by, our government and commercial customers.
TCV closed includes existing contractual obligations and presumes the exercise of all contract
options available to our customers and no termination of contracts; however, the majority of our
contracts are subject to termination provisions, including for convenience, and there can be no
guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract options will be exercised.
Remaining performance obligations represent non-cancelable contracted revenue that has not yet
been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and, in certain instances, amounts that will be
invoiced. We have elected the practical expedient, as permitted under Accounting Standards
Codification 606—Revenue from Contracts with Customers—allowing us to not disclose remaining
performance obligations for contracts with original terms of twelve months or less.
Total remaining deal value is the total remaining value of contracts and includes existing contractual
obligations and unexercised contract options available to those customers. Total remaining deal
value presumes the exercise of all contract options and no termination of contracts; however, the
majority of our contracts are subject to termination provisions, including for convenience, and there
can be no guarantee that contracts are not terminated or that contract options will be exercised.
Total remaining deal value excludes all or some portion of the value of certain commercial contracts
as a result of our ongoing assessments of customers’ financial condition, including the consideration
of such customers’ ability and intention to pay, and whether such contracts continue to meet the
criteria for revenue recognition, among other factors.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release and the accompanying tables contain the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted
income from operations, which excludes stock-based compensation and related employer payroll
taxes; adjusted operating margin; adjusted free cash flow; adjusted free cash flow margin; adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“adjusted EBITDA”); adjusted EBITDA
margin; adjusted net income; and adjusted EPS, diluted.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics described in this press release
help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting Palantir’s business, formulate business plans
and financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We exclude stock-based compensation,
which is a non-cash expense, from these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that
excluding this item provides meaningful supplemental information regarding operational
performance and provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and
evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team. We exclude employer
payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation as it is difficult to predict and outside of Palantir’s
control.
Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability
may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these
metrics have certain limitations as they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are
reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. For example, adjusted free cash flow does
not reflect our future contractual commitments or the total increase or decrease in our cash
balances for a given period. Thus, our non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in
addition to, not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP
measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. We encourage investors and others to review our
business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single
financial measure, and to view these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measure.
A reconciliation table of the most comparable GAAP financial measure to each non-GAAP financial
measure used in this press release is included at the end of this release. A reconciliation of non-
GAAP guidance measures to corresponding GAAP measures is not available on a forward-looking
basis without unreasonable effort due to the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of,
reconciling items that may be incurred in the future, such as stock-based compensation and related
employer payroll taxes, the effect of which may be significant.
