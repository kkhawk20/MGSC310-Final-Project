CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA — Apple today announced financial results for its
fiscal 2023 third quarter ended July 1, 2023. The Company posted
quarterly revenue of $81.8 billion, down 1 percent year over year, and
quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.26, up 5 percent year over year.
“We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services
during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we
saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of
iPhone,” said Tim Cook, Appleʼs CEO. “From education to the environment,
we are continuing to advance our values, while championing innovation
that enriches the lives of our customers and leaves the world better than
we found it.”
“Our June quarter year-over-year business performance improved from the
March quarter, and our installed base of active devices reached an all-time
high in every geographic segment,” said Luca Maestri, Appleʼs CFO.
“During the quarter, we generated very strong operating cash flow of $26
billion, returned over $24 billion to our shareholders, and continued to
invest in our long-term growth plans.”
Appleʼs board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share
of the Companyʼs common stock. The dividend is payable on August 17,
2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 14,
2023.
