Ford Pro, Ford Blue Drive Solid Second-Quarter Results;
Company Raises Expectations for Full-Year 2023 Profitability
• Revenue increases 12% year-over-year to $45 billion; net income ($1.9 billion) and
adjusted EBIT ($3.8 billion) also higher; cash and liquidity persistently strong
• Appeal of Ford Pro to commercial customers produces 22% revenue growth; EBIT more
than doubles to $2.4 billion, a 15% margin; software, repair services sales up
• Ford Blue gas and hybrid business posts higher wholesales and revenue, reports
$2.3 billion in EBIT; all-new global Ranger pickup even more popular, profitable
• Ford Model e revenue up 39%; scaling, competitive pricing further establishing leadership
ahead of industry’s next-generation EVs; now expecting to reach 600K run rate in 2024
• Company raises full-year 2023 guidance for adjusted EBIT to between $11 billion and
$12 billion, and for adjusted free cash flow to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion
DEARBORN, Mich., July 27, 2023 – Ford showed focus, speed and accountability in producing
solid second-quarter 2023 operating results, while taking strategic actions that are expected to
help create a high-performing business and long-term value for all stakeholders.
“The shift to powerful digital experiences and breakthrough EVs is underway and going to be
volatile, so being able to guide customers through and adapt to the pace of adoption are big
advantages for us,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley. “Ford+ is making us more resilient, efficient and
profitable, which you can see in Ford Pro’s breakout second-quarter revenue improvement
(22%) and EBIT margin (15%).”
Company Key Metrics Summary
1
Ford was again America’s top-selling brand in the quarter – net sales increased more than
11% – and for the first six months of 2023. Worldwide, demand for Ford’s fresh lineup of trucks,
SUVs and commercial vans pushed second-quarter revenue up 12%, to $45 billion. Quarterly
net income was $1.9 billion, nearly three times higher than in the year-ago period and a
4% margin. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, grew to $3.8 billion or
8.4% of revenue.
Cash flow from operations and adjusted free cash flow continued to be strong, at
$5.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. So was Ford’s balance sheet, with nearly $30 billion of
cash and more than $47 billion of liquidity at the end of Q2, both of them up sequentially and
year-over-year.
CFO John Lawler reiterated that the company has ample resources to simultaneously fund
disciplined investment in growth and return capital to shareholders – for the latter, targeting 40%
to 50% of adjusted free cash flow. On July 13, Ford’s board of directors declared the latest
regular dividend of 15 cents per share, payable Sept. 1 to shareholders of record at the close of
business on July 25.
Business Segment Highlights
In the second quarter, Ford Pro – with a winning combination of vehicles, software and services
that generates value for commercial customers and pricing power for Ford – turned 8% growth
in product shipments into a 22% jump in revenue. The business unit’s $2.4 billion in EBIT was
more than twice its profitability a year ago and represented a 15% margin.
Customer deliveries of the all-new Super Duty work truck had an immediate effect on Ford Pro’s
performance, with quarterly U.S. sales of Super Duty up 28%. Global revenue from both gas-
powered Transit and electric E-Transit commercial vans was also up.
Commercial customers are also beneficiaries of Ford’s digital innovation and rapidly expanding
software and services. Ford Pro accounts for more than 80% of the company’s nearly 550,000
paid software and services subscribers, to date, including solutions for fleet management,
telematics and EV charging.
2
Ford Blue – which engineers, makes and sells highly popular gas and hybrid vehicles, including
specialized derivative models – improved its performance in every region.
The appeal and pricing power of Ford Blue’s iconic products helped account for growth in
wholesales and revenue, and $2.3 billion in EBIT. Segment initiatives to improve quality and
reduce costs are expected to further raise its effectiveness and profitability over time.
In May, Ford Blue and Ford Pro together launched the fully redesigned, highly connected 2024
Ford Ranger. Ranger is a vital part of Ford’s global pickup leadership and is sold in more than
180 markets.
Revenue from Ford Model e’s first-generation electric vehicles increased 39% in the second
quarter; sequentially, revenue more doubled.
“The near-term pace of EV adoption will be a little slower than expected, which is going to
benefit early movers like Ford,” Farley said. “EV customers are brand loyal and we’re winning
lots of them with our high-volume, first-generation products; we’re making smart investments in
capabilities and capacity around the world; and, while others are trying to catch up, we have
clean-sheet, next-generation products in advanced development that will blow people away.”
Farley said that Ford now expects to reach a 600,000-unit EV production run rate during 2024
and will maintain flexibility, balancing growth and profitability, on the way to attaining a two-
million run rate.
Last week, citing increasing production capacity at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in
Michigan, continued work on cost scaling and improving prices for EV battery raw materials,
Ford announced lower suggested retail prices for the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck.
In April, Ford Model e announced a plan to transform Ford’s existing complex in Oakville, Ont.,
Canada for high-volume EV manufacturing – assembling battery packs and installing them in
next-generation electric vehicles produced on the same campus.
Also during the second quarter, the company:
• Opened the Ford Cologne Electrification Center in Germany, its first carbon-neutral factory
and home of the forthcoming, all-new Ford Explorer for Europe
• Completed capacity expansion for the Mustang Mach-E in Cuautitlan, Mexico, and initiated
another enlargement of the Rouge facility
• Made substantial progress on construction of a next-generation EV pickup plant in West
Tennessee, and three joint-venture battery manufacturing facilities in Tennessee and
Kentucky, and
• Started site preparation for a wholly-owned plant in Michigan that will produce lithium iron
phosphate, or LFP, EV batteries.
The in-company Ford Model e startup is also responsible for advanced digital platforms and
software across all Ford product lines. A primary example is the BlueCruise Level 2 advanced
driver-assistance system, which through the first half of 2023 had enabled more than 1.4 million
hours of hands-free driving for customers across North America.
Ford Credit generated earnings before taxes of $390 million, down from a year ago, as
expected, reflecting lower financing margin, the nonrecurrence of credit losses reserve releases
and a decline in residual values of leased vehicles – all of which were anticipated in the
company’s full-year outlook.
3
Lawler said the Ford+ plan is designed to turn great value for customers into the same for
shareholders and other stakeholders by “breaking Ford out of the cycle of low margins and high
capital that’s typified traditional automakers for way too long.”
“We’ve got big ambitions, our approach is different from anyone else’s and we’re doubling down
where we have competitive advantages – in trucks, SUVs and commercial vans,” he said. “We
think doing that, raising quality and lowering costs can earn us the kind of profitable growth and
valuation that best-in-class, technology-led industrial companies command.”
Outlook
Ford is lifting its guidance range for full-year 2023 consolidated adjusted EBIT to between
$11 billion and $12 billion. Likewise, the company is raising its expectations for full-year
adjusted free cash flow to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, with capital expenditures of
between $8 billion and $9 billion.
The guidance presumes:
• Headwinds including global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, higher
industrywide customer incentives and continued EV pricing pressure, increased warranty
costs, lower past service pension income, exchange rates and costs associated with union
contract negotiations, along with
• Tailwinds comprising an improved supply chain, higher industry volumes, upside from the
all-new Super Duty and lower commodity costs.
For its transparent, customer-centered business units, Ford now expects full-year EBIT:
• Approaching $8 billion for Ford Pro, more than double in 2022, from significant year-over-
year improvement in pricing and volume
• Of about $8 billion from Ford Blue, with higher volumes and stronger mix more than
offsetting any potential pricing headwinds, and
• To be a loss of about $4.5 billion for Ford Model e, reflecting the pricing environment,
disciplined investments in new products and capacity, and other costs.
Full-year EBT for Ford Credit is anticipated to be about $1.3 billion.
The company plans to report third-quarter 2023 financial results on Thursday, Oct. 26.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures
We use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and
segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental
information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these
non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-
period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used
by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.
• Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net income / (Loss) attributable to Ford) – Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP
measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves
comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results
of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Pre-tax special items
consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses, (ii) gains and losses on investments in equity securities, (iii)
significant personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to
match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iv) other items that we do not
necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted
EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special
items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and
OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities.
• Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income / (Loss) Margin) – Company
Adjusted EBIT Margin is Company Adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to
management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting.
• Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings / (Loss) Per Share) – Measure of
Company’s diluted net earnings / (loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special
items and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate
performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide
guidance for adjusted earnings / (loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings / (loss) per share basis because
the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with
reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.
• Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of Company’s tax rate
excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which
investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we
do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special
items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and
OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.
• Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (FCF) (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By / (Used In)
Operating Activities) – Measure of Company’s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit’s operating cash flows. The measure
contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford
Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension
contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under GAAP. This measure is
useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management’s assessment of the Company’s operating cash
flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company Adjusted FCF, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by
/ (used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with
reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain
commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special
items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net
cash provided by / (used in) our operating activities.
• Adjusted ROIC Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax from the last four quarters, divided
by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. This calculation provides management and investors with useful
information to evaluate the Company’s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted
net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt),
and certain pension / OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit
Debt), and net pension / OPEB liability.
Note: Calculated results may not sum due to rounding
