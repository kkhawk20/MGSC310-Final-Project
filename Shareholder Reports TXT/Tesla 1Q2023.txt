Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along
with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q1
earnings. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of
the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on
as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a
variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange
movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.
