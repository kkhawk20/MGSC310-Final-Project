Ford+ Again Attracts New Customers, Drives Growth in Q3;
Company Changing How it Works to Improve Quality, Costs
• Third-quarter revenue rises 11% year-over-year to $44 billion; net income of $1.2 billion
compares to a year-ago loss of $827 million; adjusted EBIT increases to $2.2 billion
• Delighting Ford Pro commercial customers with leading vehicles and services produces
higher revenue, significantly better EBIT and double-digit EBIT margin
• Ford Blue again shows the strength and durable upside of its gas and hybrid vehicles, with
higher revenue, EBIT and EBIT margin
• Ford Model e reports 44% higher shipments of electric vehicles, 26% revenue growth;
operating loss exacerbated by EV price pressure
• Ford withdraws 2023 guidance with ratification of tentative U.S. labor agreement pending
DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 26, 2023 – Ford’s third-quarter 2023 results illustrated how the
company is beginning to fulfill the growth potential of the customer-focused Ford+ plan – and
underscored the vital role of higher quality and lower costs in driving profitability.
“I’m very optimistic about the reality we’re creating with Ford+,” said President and CEO Jim
Farley. “We’re building a more dynamic, highly talented and customer-focused company at the
intersection of great vehicles, iconic brands, innovative software and high-value services.
“We’re also radically changing how we work with a series of actions that put the right people
with the right capabilities in the right places across the organization, so that our promise isn’t
masked by cost and quality issues.”
Company Key Metrics Summary
1
Ford posted third-quarter U.S. sales gains across its gas, hybrid and electric vehicle lines;
widened the lead of F-Series as America’s No. 1 truck, now well into the 47th straight year; and
was the top-selling brand in the United States through the first nine months of 2023.
Company revenue in the quarter was $44 billion, up 11% from third-quarter 2022 on flat vehicle
wholesales. Net income of $1.2 billion reversed a year-ago net loss of $827 million. The latter
included a $2.7 billion non-cash, pretax impairment on Ford’s investment in Argo AI. Adjusted
earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, in Q3 increased to $2.2 billion.
Cash flow from operations was $4.6 billion in the quarter and $12.4 billion through the first nine
months of the year. Adjusted free cash flow for the same periods was $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion,
respectively.
Ford’s balance sheet remains strong, with more than $29 billion in cash and $51 billion in liquidity at
the end of Q3, providing important financial flexibility. That included a $4 billion contingent liquidity
facility that the company secured in August in anticipation of business uncertainties.
To attack quality and cost issues, Ford last week completed a sequence of organizational
changes in support of Ford+, creating an end-to-end global industrial system under Kumar
Galhotra, who was named chief operating officer.
The system – comprising vehicle engineering and cycle planning, gas and hybrid programs,
supply chain management, and manufacturing – is expected to be an effective and efficient
operational engine for all three auto business segments: Ford Blue, Ford Model e and Ford Pro.
Farley said that Galhotra’s organization together with Doug Field’s EVs, Digital and Design team
“will support the businesses and their customers with great technologies and products, while
raising quality, reducing costs and rooting out waste with a vengeance.”
Business Segment Highlights
Ford Pro helps commercial customers transform their operations with great gas, hybrid and electric
vehicles and a growing array of value-added services. In the third quarter, the business generated
$1.7 billion in EBIT – a 12% margin – on $13.8 billion in revenue, which was up 16%.
Through the first three quarters of the year, Ford Pro gained nearly two points of share in the U.S.
commercial truck and van market on the continued strength of its Super Duty truck and Transit van
franchises. In Europe, the company is launching an all-new version of the Transit Custom van, the
company’s flagship business-related vehicle in the region.
Ford Pro’s software subscriptions and mobile repair orders both increased sharply.
Ford Blue, which markets a lineup of gas and hybrid vehicles Farley calls “the best I’ve seen,”
delivered $1.7 billion in third-quarter EBIT – up 17% from last year. The business was again
profitable in every region where it operates, driven by a strong and fresh product portfolio.
Last month, Ford Blue revealed gas and hybrid versions of the 2024 F-150 pickup, which
combines “Built Ford Tough” with power and smarts – the most connected and technologically
capable F-150 yet. Third-quarter sales of hybrid vehicles jumped more than 40%, led by F-150
and Maverick trucks. F-150 hybrid volumes were up 47% from a year ago; hybrids now account
for 57% of all Maverick trucks sold.
2
Ford Blue is rolling out new derivatives of its iconic nameplates, which are hugely popular with
customers and generate superior revenue and margins. They include the forthcoming Ranger
Raptor pickup, Mustang GTD super-car and track variants, and new extensions of the Bronco
and Maverick nameplates.
Third-quarter wholesales of Ford Model e’s first-generation electric vehicles increased 44% and
revenue was up 26%. The segment recorded an EBIT loss of $1.3 billion, attributable to
continued investment in next-generation EVs and challenging market dynamics.
According to the company, many North America customers interested in buying EVs are
unwilling to pay premiums for them over gas or hybrid vehicles, sharply compressing EV prices
and profitability. Partly in response, Ford this month introduced the F-150 Lightning Flash
pickup, combining popular technology-based features in a competitively priced electric truck.
“Ford is able to balance production of gas, hybrid and electric vehicles to match the speed of EV
adoption in a way that others can’t,” said CFO John Lawler. “That’s obviously good for
customers, who get the products they want – and good for us, too, because disciplined capital
allocation and not chasing scale at all costs maximizes profitability and cash flow.”
All Ford customers will benefit over time from newly imagined, developed and delivered
software-enabled services. During the third quarter, total paid software subscriptions were up
more than 50% year-over-year and are now approaching 600,000.
In August, the company announced that former Apple veteran Peter Stern would establish and
lead Ford Integrated Services. Stern’s team will market high-value services leveraging
technologies such as the Ford BlueCruise advanced driver-assistance system – with which
customers have now driven more than 125 million hands-free miles – and in areas like
productivity, security, and next-generation buying and service experiences.
3
Quarterly earnings before taxes for Ford Credit were $358 million – down from a year ago, as
expected, because of lower lease residuals and financing margin, along with a nonrecurrence of
gains in derivative market valuations.
Full-Year 2023 Guidance Withdrawn Pending Ratification of Tentative U.S. Labor Agreement
Through the third quarter, Ford earned $9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT toward the full-year range of
$11 billion to $12 billion it affirmed in late July. Based on that and strong demand for Ford’s
products, Lawler said that the company had been poised to deliver profitability within that range.
However, given effects of the UAW strike and with ratification of the tentative agreement with
the union that was announced Wednesday night pending, Ford is withdrawing its guidance for
full-year 2023 operating results.
Ford plans to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 financial results on Thursday, Feb. 1.

manganese, can disrupt Ford’s production of vehicles;
• To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford
has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material
suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well
as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast;
• Ford’s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+;
• Ford’s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall
campaigns, or increased warranty costs;
• Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint

market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the
automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is
unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced;
• Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United
States;
• With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical
developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events;
• Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or
significant geopolitical event;
6
• Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting
from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors;
• Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit’s investments, including marketable
securities, can have a significant effect on results;
• Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at
competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market
volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors;
• The impact of government incentives on Ford’s business could be significant, and Ford’s receipt
of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback;
• Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual
values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles;
• Economic and demographic experience for pension and OPEB plans (e.g., discount rates or

data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened
expectations to safeguard their personal information; and
• Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection
regulations, or other regulations.
We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking
statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may
be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of

Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures
We use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and
segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental
information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these
non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-
period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used
by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.
• Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net income / (Loss) attributable to Ford) – Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP
measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves
comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results
of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Pre-tax special items
consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses, (ii) gains and losses on investments in equity securities, (iii)
significant personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to
match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iv) other items that we do not
necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted
EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special
items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and
OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities.
• Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income / (Loss) Margin) – Company
Adjusted EBIT Margin is Company Adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to
management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting.
• Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings / (Loss) Per Share) – Measure of
Company’s diluted net earnings / (loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special
items and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate
performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide
guidance for adjusted earnings / (loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings / (loss) per share basis because
the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with
reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.
• Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of Company’s tax rate
excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which
investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we
do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special
items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and
OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.
• Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (FCF) (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By / (Used In)
Operating Activities) – Measure of Company’s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit’s operating cash flows. The measure
contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford
Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension
contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under GAAP. This measure is
useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management’s assessment of the Company’s operating cash
flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company Adjusted FCF, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by
/ (used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with
reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain
commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special
items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net
cash provided by / (used in) our operating activities.
• Adjusted ROIC – Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax from the last four quarters, divided
by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. This calculation provides management and investors with useful
information to evaluate the Company’s after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted
net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt),
and certain pension / OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit
Debt), and net pension / OPEB liability.
Note: Calculated results may not sum due to rounding
