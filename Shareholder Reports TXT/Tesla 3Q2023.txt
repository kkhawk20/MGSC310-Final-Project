AUSTIN, Texas, October 2, 2023 – In the third quarter, we
produced over 430,000 vehicles and delivered over 435,000
vehicles. A sequential decline in volumes was caused by planned
downtimes for factory upgrades, as discussed on the most recent
earnings call. Our 2023 volume target of around 1.8 million
vehicles remains unchanged.

Our net income and cash flow results will be announced along
with the rest of our financial performance when we announce Q3
earnings. Tesla vehicle deliveries represent only one measure of
the company’s financial performance and should not be relied on
as an indicator of quarterly financial results, which depend on a
variety of factors, including the cost of sales, foreign exchange
movements and mix of directly leased vehicles.
