AMD Reports Second Quarter 2023 Financial Results
SANTA CLARA, Calif. ― Aug. 1, 2023 ― AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced revenue for
the second quarter of 2023 of $5.4 billion, gross margin of 46%, operating loss of $20 million, net
income of $27 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.02. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin
was 50%, operating income was $1.1 billion, net income was $948 million and diluted earnings per
share was $0.58.
“We delivered strong results in the second quarter as 4th Gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processors
ramped significantly,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Our AI engagements increased by more
than seven times in the quarter as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting
future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale. We made strong progress meeting key hardware
and software milestones to address the growing customer pull for our data center AI solutions and are
on-track to launch and ramp production of MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter.”
“We are pleased with our second quarter execution,” said AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer Jean Hu.
“Looking to the third quarter, we expect our Data Center and Client segment revenues to each grow by
a double-digit percentage sequentially driven by increasing demand for our EPYC and Ryzen
processors, partially offset by Gaming and Embedded segment declines.”

Quarterly Segment Summary
 Data Center segment revenue was $1.3 billion, down 11% year-over-year primarily due to
lower 3rd Gen EPYC processor sales as Enterprise demand was soft and Cloud inventory
levels were elevated at some customers.
o Revenue increased 2% sequentially, as 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ CPU revenue nearly
doubled and EPYC CPU Enterprise sales increased, partially offset by a decline in
adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) data center products.
o There are now more than 670 AMD-powered cloud instances publicly available.
o AMD Instinct™ MI300A and MI300X GPUs are sampling to leading HPC, Cloud and AI
customers.
 Client segment revenue was $998 million, down 54% year-over-year due to reduced processor
shipments resulting from a weaker PC market and a significant inventory correction across the
PC supply chain.
o Revenue increased 35% sequentially as AMD Ryzen™ 7000 Series CPU sales grew
significantly, and PC market conditions improved.
o More than 100 AMD-powered commercial PC platforms are set to launch this year.
 Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Semi-custom revenue
grew year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue.
o Revenue declined 10% sequentially primarily due to lower gaming graphics sales.
 Embedded segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year primarily driven by
strength in the Industrial, Vision and Healthcare, Automotive and Test and Emulation markets.
o Revenue decreased 7% sequentially primarily driven by softness in the
Communications market.
o The new AMD Versal™ Premium VP1902 adaptive SoC, Spartan™ Ultrascale+™
FPGAs and enhanced versions of the Vivado™ and Vitis™ software platforms are
expanding AMD’s adaptive computing product leadership.

(*) In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP
gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.
AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting
periods. For fiscal 2023, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments,
reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of
its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press
release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare
its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance
across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and
for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings
press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with
GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non
GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this
earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial
outlook, which is based on current expectations as of August 1, 2023 and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and
uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired
intangible assets and acquisition-related and other costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that
are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time.
AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,224 $ 1,257 $ 2,139 $ 2,481 $ 4,106
The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by
adjusting GAAP net income (loss) for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee,
stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense (including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles), acquisition-related
and other costs. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and
lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA
because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items
that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may
not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an
alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.

The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by
adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a
percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release
because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free
cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view
free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.
