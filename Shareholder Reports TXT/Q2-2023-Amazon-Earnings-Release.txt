“It was another strong quarter of progress for Amazon,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “We continued lowering our cost to
serve in our fulfillment network, while also providing Prime customers with the fastest delivery speeds we’ve ever recorded.
Our AWS growth stabilized as customers started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment, and AWS has
continued to add to its meaningful leadership position in the cloud with a slew of generative AI releases that make it much
easier and more cost-effective for companies to train and run models (Trainium and Inferentia chips), customize Large
Language Models to build generative AI applications and agents (Bedrock), and write code much more efficiently with
CodeWhisperer. We’re also continuing to see strong demand for our advertising services as the team keeps innovating for
brands, including the ramp up for Thursday Night Football with the ability for advertisers to tailor their spots by audience and
create interactive experiences for consumers. We remain excited about what lies ahead for customers and the company.”
Highlights
Obsessing over the customer experience
Amazon obsesses over how to make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true for consumers, sellers, brands,
developers, enterprises, and creators. For example, Amazon:
• Delivered its largest selection of products to U.S. Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in the quarter. The
company now offers U.S. Prime members free Same-Day or One-Day Delivery on tens of millions of the most popular
items. Across the top 60 largest U.S. metro areas, more than half of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day
in the quarter. So far this year, Amazon has delivered more than 1.8 billion units to U.S. Prime members the same or
next day—nearly four times the number of units delivered at those speeds by this point in 2019.
• Held the biggest Prime Day event ever on July 11-12, in the third quarter, as Prime members worldwide purchased
more than 375 million items and saved more than $2.5 billion. This year, Amazon offered more deals than any past
Prime Day, with Home, Fashion, and Beauty among the top-selling deal categories. This was the largest Prime Day
ever for Amazon’s independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses, and the first where
U.S.-based Prime members could shop deals directly from merchant sites using Buy with Prime.
• Increased selection in the U.S. Amazon store. Amazon added new beauty and fashion brands, including D’Amelio
Footwear, Dyson hair care, IT Cosmetics, Ralph Lauren Fragrances, and Urban Decay, and extended its collaboration
with Victoria’s Secret. This marks the first time Victoria’s Secret lingerie and apparel are available through a retail
partner in North America. Amazon also expanded its selection of grocery items from brands such as General Mills and
Coca-Cola.
• Announced Amazon Business is one of our fastest growing offerings, with a $35 billion annualized gross sales run rate
and serving more than 6 million customers. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities, and organizations to
procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at discounted prices.
• Enabled customers worldwide to save more than $1 billion in the last 12 months through Subscribe & Save, a program
that helps customers save time and money on regularly scheduled deliveries. Customers select their preferred delivery
frequency for eligible products and can cancel or change their subscription at any time. The program has tens of
millions of global subscribers with hundreds of millions of subscriptions.
• Announced that Amazon Day deliveries, which give Prime members the ability to choose a designated day of the week
that makes sense for them to receive their orders, saved 136 million boxes in 2022. On top of making deliveries work
for customers’ personal schedules, this free Prime benefit uses 30% fewer boxes on average.
• Released Amazon’s annual U.S. Small Business Empowerment Report for 2022, which detailed that more than 60% of
sales in Amazon’s store came from independent sellers, most of which are small and medium-sized businesses. U.S.-
based independent sellers sold more than 4.1 billion products and averaged more than $230,000 in sales. Amazon also
announced a Small Business Search filter, which helps customers easily discover and shop for products from small
businesses and artisans while shopping in Amazon’s store.
• Marked the 10th anniversary of Amazon.in and announced that Amazon India has enabled cumulative ecommerce
exports of over $7 billion. By 2025, Amazon India has a goal to enable cumulative ecommerce exports of $20 billion,
digitize 10 million small businesses, and create 2 million jobs in India.
• Premiered AIR, which launched in more theaters worldwide than any previous Amazon Original film. The film
subsequently debuted on Prime Video and ranked No. 3 on Nielsen’s Streaming Top 10 list during the first three days
of its release. The company also premiered additional Amazon Original films and series including the final seasons of
Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan and Emmy-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel; the global spy thriller Citadel, which was
the No. 1 title on Prime Video in nearly 200 countries and territories during its premiere weekend; and Emmy-
nominated Jury Duty, which was the No. 1 title on Freevee during the month it premiered and delivered the highest
number of viewers in the U.S. on Freevee in a single month.
• Earned 68 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including three nominations in the Outstanding Comedy Series
category for Prime Video’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Freevee’s Jury Duty, and MGM’s Wednesday. Jury Duty
became the first advertising-based video-on-demand series nominated in a major Emmy category, while The
Marvelous Mrs. Maisel became the most nominated streaming comedy in Emmy history with 80 nominations over its
five seasons. Daisy Jones & The Six also earned nine nominations and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power
earned six nominations.
• Grew Prime Video’s international slate of content with more than 40 new local Amazon Originals and live sporting
events. Medellín (France) and My Fault (Spain) became the most watched non-English-language local Original titles in
Prime Video history outside of their home territories. New global programming also included Deadloch (Australia),
Caravana das Drags (Brazil), The Gryphon (Germany), Dahaad (India), Takeshi’s Castle (Japan), De Viaje con los
Derbez Season Three (Mexico), and Gangs of Lagos (Nigeria).
• Launched Amazon MGM Studios Distribution to license Amazon Original and MGM library content to third parties
after debuting on Prime Video. This will include movies and TV series, such as Coming 2 America and The Marvelous
Mrs. Maisel, among others. Titles available cover a variety of highly marketable formats and genres with distribution
rights available.
• Partnered with Pinterest to display ads on its website for products sold in Amazon’s store, where over 463 million
people go each month to find recipes, home, and style inspiration. As Pinterest’s first partner for third-party ads,
Amazon will make it easier for customers to discover and buy relevant products on Amazon and provide value for
brands and advertisers.
• Announced new commitments and migrations from AWS customers.
• Omnicom, a global marketing and communications company, will use AWS generative artificial intelligence
(generative AI) and machine learning services, including Amazon Bedrock and Amazon EC2 Trn1n instances

dynamics change and new information becomes available.
• AWS continued to expand its infrastructure footprint to meet customer demand, launching AWS Local Zones in
Auckland, New Zealand, and Manila, Philippines, and an Amazon CloudFront location in Nigeria.
Inventing on behalf of customers
Amazon is driven by a passion for invention across all of its business areas. The company builds new products and services that
customers ask for, and also invents new ones that customers didn’t know they wanted but make their lives or businesses better
in some meaningful way. For example, Amazon:
• Announced new AWS technologies and capabilities that help customers of all sizes take advantage of generative AI,
improve productivity, and enhance their security posture. These include:
• More choice for Amazon Bedrock customers with the addition of Cohere as a foundation model provider and
the latest foundation models from Anthropic and Stability AI.
• Agents for Amazon Bedrock, a capability that makes it easier for developers to create generative-AI based
applications that can complete complex tasks and deliver customized, up-to-date answers based on
proprietary data.
• AWS HealthScribe, a new HIPAA-eligible service for healthcare software providers that uses speech
recognition and generative AI to automatically create preliminary clinical documentation from patient-
clinician conversations.
• Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) P5 instances, the latest generation instances optimized for
generative AI and HPC, powered by NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs.
• AWS AppFabric, a service that helps IT and security teams more easily manage and secure applications.
• The general availability of Amazon Security Lake, which centralizes security data from AWS, on-premises,
and other cloud environments, into a purpose-built data lake. This gives customers broad visibility to
investigate and respond to security events.
• New capabilities for Amazon GuardDuty, AWS’s threat detection service that helps protect customers from
the latest threats using machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence. New
capabilities include new container runtime protection for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS),
extended coverage for data stored in Amazon Aurora, and support for serverless applications in AWS
Lambda.
• Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, a new configuration for Amazon Aurora (AWS’s high-performance, fully-
managed relational database service) that offers improved price performance and predictable pricing for
customers with input/output (I/O)-intensive applications.
• The AWS Generative AI Innovation Center to help customers successfully build and deploy generative AI
solutions. AWS is investing $100 million in the program, which will connect AWS AI and machine learning
experts with customers around the globe to help them envision, design, and launch new generative AI
products, services, and processes.
• Introduced new Echo devices to give customers more choices for how to access Alexa. Echo Pop features a new
hardware design with a front-facing directional speaker; Echo Show 5 features a redesigned speaker and new space-
themed design for the Echo Show 5 Kids; and wireless Echo Buds deliver high-quality audio and access to Alexa on
the go. To date, Amazon has sold more than half a billion Alexa-enabled devices globally.
• Expanded the Amazon Fire tablet family with the Fire Max 11, Amazon’s biggest and most powerful tablet with an
11-inch display, durable and eco-friendly design, processor that’s almost 50% faster than any other Amazon tablet, 14
hours of battery life, fingerprint recognition, and Alexa integration.
• Expanded offerings of Alexa Smart Properties—which delivers Alexa experiences in hotels, vacation rentals,
apartments, and other properties—to include Atria Management Company, which is bringing Alexa to its senior living
facilities across the U.S., and Circa Resort & Casino, which is adding Alexa to all of its hotel rooms in Las Vegas,
Nevada.
• Announced Fire TV Channels, a free ad-supported service that offers Fire TV customers access to content from over
400 providers like NHL, Xbox, and TMZ. Customers can watch live, on-demand, and short-form content in categories
such as news, sports, music videos, entertainment, food and cooking, video games, and travel. Fire TV Channels
brings together premium free content that spans diverse customer interests from a growing list of household names like
ABC News, CBS Sports HQ, FOX Sports, Major League Baseball, NBC News Now, Martha Stewart, and America’s
Test Kitchen.
• Introduced new, more advanced machine learning models to help advertisers reach previously unaddressable audiences
with Amazon Ads. The new machine learning models analyze a range of signals to help advertisers predict and reach
highly relevant audiences with optimal cost-efficiency, which is critical to reaching desired audiences as the
advertising industry moves away from third-party cookies. Performance improvements include an increase in click-
through rate, an increase in return on ad spend, and a decrease in cost per impression.
• Launched Amazon Hub Delivery in the U.S. In this flexible delivery program, Amazon partners with local businesses,
such as florists or dry cleaners, to deliver packages for Amazon. Partners receive packages each morning and can make
deliveries when it works best for their schedule. Amazon’s goal is to onboard 2,500 partners in 23 states by the end of
2023.
Supporting employees, delivery service partners, communities, and the environment
In addition to its focus on customers, Amazon strives to make every day better for its employees and delivery service partners.
Amazon also believes that success and scale bring broad responsibility to help the planet, future generations, and local
communities in which the company has a significant presence. For example, the company:
• Was named the top corporate giver in the Puget Sound metro region by the Puget Sound Business Journal and in the
Washington, D.C., metro region by The Washington Business Journal. Amazon was recognized for donations to more
than 300 local organizations, supporting equity in education, affordable housing, and regional economic development.
• Doubled the capacity of Amazon’s Disaster Relief Hub in Atlanta, Georgia, where 2.4 million relief items were pre-
positioned ahead of the 2023 hurricane season. Items are distributed in the wake of natural disasters to nonprofits and
other aid partners that quickly help communities impacted by hurricanes or other disasters. Amazon also launched a
Disaster Relief Hub in Japan, bringing Amazon’s global total number of Disaster Relief hubs to five.
• Awarded 400 scholarships for students from underserved and underrepresented communities to attend a U.S. college
or university through Amazon Future Engineer, the company’s computer science education program. Since launching
the program five years ago, Amazon has awarded $38 million in scholarships to 950 U.S. students who are also
granted paid internships at Amazon.
• Committed to hire at least 5,000 displaced refugees in Europe by 2026 and expanded Amazon’s Welcome Door
program to Australia, Germany, and Poland. The program, which launched in 2022 in the U.S., provides resources and
support to refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant employees.
• Announced that in 2022 in North America, more than 7 million products were shipped without additional Amazon
packaging. This is part of the company’s efforts to reduce excess packaging for customer orders without
compromising delivery speed or product care with Amazon’s Ship In Own Container program, where items are
shipped without additional packaging.
• Announced the global expansion of Amazon’s Cancer Advocacy, Resources, Education, and Support (CARES)
program by the end of 2023 for all Amazon employees and family members with cancer. CARES helps alleviate stress
related to working while sick and helps with accessing the best possible care, benefits management, health system
navigation, appointment scheduling, paperwork, and more. The program started in 2022 and operates in 23 countries.
• Opened Metropolitan Park (“Met Park”), the first phase of Amazon’s second headquarters, in Arlington, Virginia. The
2.1 million-square-foot development includes over 50,000 square feet of retail space that prioritizes local minority- and
women-owned businesses, protected bike lanes, over 2.5 acres of public park space, and will operate with zero carbon
emissions. Other features include low-carbon concrete, water capture and reuse, and landscaped roofs where plantings
will reduce buildings’ energy consumption.
• Ranked No. 1 on LinkedIn’s Top Companies, an annual list of the most sought-after places to work and grow a career
in the U.S., Japan, and Spain; No. 1 on the Harvard CAPS Harris Poll of Most Favorable Institutions, ahead of all
other companies and government institutions, including the U.S. military; No. 3 on Boston Consulting Group’s annual
Most Innovative Companies report; and No. 3 on Morning Consult’s Most Trusted Brands list. Amazon also ranked in
the top 10 for the 15th consecutive year on the Axios Harris Poll 100, an annual ranking of the reputation of the most
visible companies in America.
Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of August 3, 2023, and are subject to
substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events,
the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.
Third Quarter 2023 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.0 billion, or to grow between 9% and 13% compared
with third quarter 2022. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 120 basis points from foreign
exchange rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in third quarter
2022.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal
settlements are concluded.
A conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at
amazon.com/ir. This call will contain forward-looking statements and other material information regarding the Company’s
financial and operating results.
These forward-looking statements are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a
variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business
opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales
derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management
of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of
inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops
commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of
fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products,
services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, global economic
and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify
many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in
Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent filings.
Our investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information
about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC, corporate
governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases, which may contain
material information about us, and you may subscribe to be notified of new information posted to this site.
