AMD Reports First Quarter 2023 Financial Results
SANTA CLARA, Calif. ― May 2, 2023 ― AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced revenue for the
first quarter of 2023 of $5.4 billion, gross margin of 44%, operating loss of $145 million, net loss of $139
million and diluted loss per share of $0.09. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 50%, operating
income was $1.1 billion, net income was $970 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.60.
“We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better than expected revenue and earnings in a
mixed demand environment," said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. "We launched multiple leadership
products and made significant progress accelerating our AI roadmap and customer engagements in the
quarter. Longer-term, we see significant growth opportunities as we successfully deliver our roadmaps,
execute our strategic data center and embedded priorities and accelerate adoption of our AI portfolio."
“Our strategically important Data Center and Embedded segments contributed more than 50 percent
of revenue in the first quarter," said AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer Jean Hu. "For the second quarter we
expect sequential growth in our Data Center and Client segments offset by modest declines in our
Gaming and Embedded segments. We remain confident in our growth in the second half of the year as
the PC and server markets strengthen and our new products ramp.”

(*) In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including non-
GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per
share. AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the
reporting periods. For fiscal 2023, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP
adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-
GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end
of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier
for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in
comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative
of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial
measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported
results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable
GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking
non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of May 2, 2023 and assumptions
and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin outlook typically include stock-
based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments
are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP
measures is not practicable at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a
result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

(1) The Data Center segment primarily includes server microprocessors (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), data processing
units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.
The Client segment primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and
chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers.
The Gaming segment primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.
The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products.
From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.
All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as
amortization of acquisition-related intangible asset, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and

Depreciation and amortization 159 130
Amortization of acquired intangible assets 823 479
Acquisition-related costs 115 233
Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,257 $ 1,967
The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined
by adjusting GAAP net income (loss) for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision, equity income in investee,
stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense (including amortization of acquired intangible assets) and acquisition-
related costs. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and
lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA
because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding
items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA
may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted
EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and
financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.
(3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow $ 328 $ 924
Free cash flow margin % 6 % 16 %
The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by
adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a
percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release
because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free
cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view
free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.
