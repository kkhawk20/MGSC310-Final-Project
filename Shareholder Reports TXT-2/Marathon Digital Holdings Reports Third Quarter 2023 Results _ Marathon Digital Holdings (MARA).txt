XBRL 
The Company recorded net income of $64.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, during the three months ended ZIP
September 30, 2023, compared to a net loss of $72.5 million, or $0.62 loss per share, in the same period last year.
Revenues were $97.8 million for the quarter, significantly above third quarter 2022 revenues of $12.7 million, as a 467% increase in bitcoin production was
amplified by 32% higher average bitcoin prices during the current year period.
Gains on digital assets were $31.7 million in the quarter as the Company sold 66% of the bitcoin produced in the quarter to fund operating costs. Realized
gains were partially offset by higher impairment in the carrying value of digital assets, $11.9 million versus $1.4 million in the prior-year period. This quarter
also uniquely benefited from a $82.6 million gain from the extinguishment of debt while the year-ago period included a $29.8 million gain on sale of
equipment, a $25.0 million legal reserve, and a $39.0 million impairment due to vendor bankruptcy, all of which did not reoccur in 2023.
Adjusted EBITDA was $43.7 million in the current year period compared with a loss of $6.1 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase was
primarily due to improving profitability as total margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, improved to $38.2 million, up from a loss of $1.1 million in
the year-ago period. Reported adjusted EBITDA also benefited from $19.8 million of bitcoin gains net of impairment losses versus a $1.4 million impairment
loss in the third quarter of 2022.

Management Commentary
“We made significant progress on our 2023 strategic priorities in the third quarter,” said Fred Thiel, Marathon’s chairman and CEO. “First, we grew our
energized hash rate 8% quarter-over-quarter to 19.1 exahashes. In addition, our new facility in Garden City started energizing last week and is expected to be
fully operational later this month. Second, we experienced significantly higher uptime as optimization efforts helped increase our U.S. average operational
hash rate 18% from last quarter to 14.2 exahashes. Third, we energized our first joint venture and our first international location in the UAE. This initial success
has helped open new opportunities, and we recently entered into a new joint venture in Paraguay powered by hydroelectricity.
“In preparation for next year's halving, we took proactive measures to strengthen our financial position during the quarter. The $417 million note exchange
completed in September reduced our long-term debt by 56% and captured a total of approximately $101 million in cash savings for our shareholders. For the
first time in two years, our combined cash and bitcoin holdings exceeded our debt at the quarter's end.
“Looking ahead, we should reach 26 exahash by year-end 2023, and we expect to grow our hash rate by approximately 30% in 2024. We expect to continue
strengthening Marathon’s position as one of the largest and most energy-efficient Bitcoin mining operations globally.”

Investor Notice
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and
forward-looking statements described under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2022, filed with the SEC on March 16, 2023. If any of these risks were to occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In
that event, the value of our securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. The risks and uncertainties we describe are not the only
ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. In addition, our
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results in the future.
Future changes in the network-wide mining difficulty rate or Bitcoin hash rate may also materially affect the future performance of Marathon's production of
bitcoin. Additionally, all discussions of financial metrics assume mining difficulty rates as of November 2023. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below.
Forward-Looking Statements
Statements made in this press release include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “will,” “plan,” “should,”
“expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,” or comparable terminology. Such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to certain risks, trends and
uncertainties, many of which the Company cannot predict with accuracy and some of which the Company might not even anticipate and involve factors
that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or suggested. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-
looking statements and are advised to consider the factors listed above together with the additional factors under the heading “Risk Factors” in the
Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K, as may be supplemented or amended by the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Company assumes
no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements that become untrue because of subsequent events, new information or otherwise.

(1) The Company defines the Share of Available Miner Rewards as the total amount of block rewards including transaction fees that Marathon earned during
the period divided by the total amount of block rewards and transaction fees awarded by the Bitcoin network during the period. The company defines
Energized Hash Rate as the total hash rate that could theoretically be generated if all mining rigs that have been operational / energized are currently in
operation and running at 100% of the manufacturers’ specifications (includes mining servers that are offline for maintenance or similar reasons). The
Company uses this metric as an indicator of progress in bringing rigs on-line. The Company defines Avg. Operational Hash Rate as the average hash rate that
was actually generated during the period from all operational miners. The Company uses this metric as an indicator of its operational progress. The Company
defines Installed Hash Rate as the sum of Energized Hash Rate and hash rate that has been installed but is not yet operational (e.g. mining rigs that have
been installed, but are not yet energized and in operation). The Company uses this metric as an indicator of progress in deploying mining rigs at its
production sites. Hash rates are estimates based on the manufacturers’ specifications. All figures are estimates and rounded.
The Company believes that these metrics are useful as an indicator of potential bitcoin production. However, these metrics cannot be tied directly to any
production level expected to be actually achieved as (a) there may be delays in the energization of Installed Hash Rate (b) the Company cannot predict when
installed and energized rigs may be offline for any reason, including curtailment or machine failure and (c) the Company cannot predict Global Hash Rate
(and therefore the Company’s share of the Global Hash Rate), which has significant impact on the Company’s ability to generate bitcoin in any given period.
(2) Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, the Company also provides adjusted EBITDA and total margin excluding depreciation and
amortization, which are non-GAAP measures. The Company provides investors with reconciliations from net loss to adjusted EBITDA and total margin to
total margin excluding depreciation and amortization as components of Management’s Discussion and Analysis. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as
(a) GAAP net income (loss) plus (b) adjustments to add back the impacts of (1) depreciation and amortization, (2) interest expense, (3) income tax expense
(benefit) and (4) adjustments for non-cash and non-recurring items which currently include (i) stock compensation expense, (ii) impairments of patents and
(iii) gains and losses from extinguishment of debt. The Company defines total margin excluding depreciation and amortization as (a) GAAP total margin less
(b) depreciation and amortization.
Adjusted EBITDA and total margin excluding depreciation and amortization are not financial measures of performance under GAAP and, as a result, these
measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they
are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not meant to be
considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Interim Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K as filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Management uses adjusted EBITDA, total margin excluding depreciation and amortization, and the supplemental
information provided herein as a means of understanding, managing, and evaluating business performance and to help inform operating decision making.
The Company relies primarily on our condensed consolidated financial statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our financial performance and use
the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
