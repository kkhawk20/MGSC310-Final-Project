SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – (BUSINESS WIRE) – July 31, 2023 – SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SOFI), a
member-centric, one-stop shop for digital financial services that helps members borrow, save, spend, invest and

“We delivered another quarter of record financial results and generated our ninth consecutive quarter of record
adjusted net revenue, which was up 37% year-over-year. Record revenue at the company level was driven by record
revenue in both our Technology Platform business segment and our Financial Services business segment coupled
with continued strong Lending business segment revenue growth. We also generated our fourth consecutive quarter
of record adjusted EBITDA of $77 million, representing a 43% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin and a 16%
margin overall, as well as a 36% incremental GAAP net income margin,” said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi
Technologies, Inc.

Noto continued: “Our record number of member additions and strong momentum in product and cross-buy adds,
along with improving operating efficiency, reflects the benefits of our broad product suite and unique Financial
Services Productivity Loop (FSPL) strategy. We added over 584,000 new members during the second quarter, and
ended with over 6.2 million total members, up 44% year-over-year. We also added nearly 847,000 new products
during the second quarter, and ended with over 9.4 million total products, a 43% annual increase.”
Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by $2.7 billion, up 26% during the second quarter to $12.7 billion at quarter-
end, and over 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are
from direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the second quarter, the median FICO score
was 747. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has
had a significant impact on debit spending, with continued strong cross-buy trends from this attractive member base
1
into Lending and other Financial Services products. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million,
nearly 98% of our deposits were insured at quarter end.
As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans.
Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize
returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $63.1 million of
GAAP net income at a 17% margin.”
Consolidated Results
Second quarter total GAAP net revenue increased 37% to $498.0 million from the prior-year period's $362.5
million. Second quarter adjusted net revenue of $488.8 million was up 37% from the same prior-year period's
$356.1 million. Second quarter record adjusted EBITDA of $76.8 million increased 278% from the same prior year
period's $20.3 million.
SoFi hit a number of key financial inflection points in the quarter, including adjusted EBITDA exceeding share-
based compensation expense of $75.9 million for the second consecutive quarter. Additionally, SoFi improved
contribution loss in the Financial Services segment to $4 million versus $24 million in the first quarter of 2023 and
$54 million in the second quarter of 2022. The improvement in the Financial Services business segment
contribution loss reinforces the company’s confidence in achieving positive contribution profit in all three business
segments by year end, as well as overall GAAP profitability for the company for the fourth quarter of 2023. SoFi
recorded a GAAP net loss of $47.5 million for the second quarter of 2023, an improvement from the prior-year
period's net loss of $95.8 million.
Member and Product Growth
SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the second quarter of 2023. Record
new member additions of over 584,000 brought total members to over 6.2 million by quarter-end, up over 1.9
million, or 44%, from the end of 2022's second quarter.
New product additions of nearly 847,000 in the second quarter brought total products to over 9.4 million at quarter-
end, up 43% from 6.6 million at the same prior year quarter-end.

Note: For additional information on our company metrics, including the definitions of "Members", "Total Products" and "Technology Platform Total
Accounts", see Table 6 in the “Financial Tables” herein.
(1) The company includes SoFi accounts on the Galileo platform-as-a-service in its total Technology Platform accounts metric to better align with the
presentation of Technology Platform segment revenue.
(2) In 2023, Technology Platform total accounts reflects the previously disclosed migration by one of our clients of the majority of its processing volumes to
a pure processor. These accounts remained open for administrative purposes through the end of 2022, and were included in our total accounts in such
period.
In the Financial Services segment, total products increased by 47% year-over-year, to 7.9 million from 5.4 million
in the second quarter of 2022. SoFi Money (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts)
grew 47% year-over-year to 2.7 million products, SoFi Invest grew 18% year-over-year to 2.3 million products, and
SoFi Relay grew 90% year-over-year to 2.6 million products.
Lending products increased 25% year-over-year to 1.5 million products, driven primarily by continued record
growth in personal loans.
Technology Platform enabled accounts increased by 11% year-over-year to 129.4 million.
Lending Segment Results
Lending segment GAAP and adjusted net revenues were $331.4 million and $322.2 million, respectively, for the
second quarter of 2023, both up 29% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Higher loan balances and net interest
margin expansion drove strong growth in net interest income.
Lending segment second quarter contribution profit of $183.3 million increased 29% from $142.0 million in the
same prior-year period. Contribution margin using Lending adjusted net revenue remained healthy at 57% in both
the second quarter of 2023 and the same prior-year period. These advances reflect SoFi’s ability to capitalize on
continued strong demand for its lending products.

___________________
(1) The cumulative fair value adjustments for personal loans during the three months ended June 30, 2023 were primarily impacted by higher origination
volume, partially offset by lower fair value marks driven primarily by a higher discount rate, while the cumulative fair value adjustments for student loans
were primarily impacted by a higher weighted average discount rate and higher prepayment rate assumption, which also resulted in lower fair value
marks.
(2) Each component of the fair value of loans is impacted by charge-offs during the period. Our fair value assumption for annual default rate incorporates fair
value markdowns on loans beginning when they are 10 days or more delinquent, with additional markdowns at 30, 60 and 90 days past due.
The following table summarizes the significant inputs to the fair value model for personal and student loans:

___________________
(1) Represents the average coupon rate on loans held on balance sheet, weighted by unpaid principal balance outstanding at the balance sheet date.
Second quarter Lending segment total origination volume increased 37% year-over-year, as a result of continued
strong demand for personal loans.
Record personal loan originations of over $3.7 billion in the second quarter of 2023 were up $1.3 billion, or 51%,
year-over-year, and rose 27% sequentially. This strong performance was aided by years of investment in technology
to automate and accelerate the application-to-approval process for qualified borrowers and constant testing of risk
4
controls and underwriting models to maintain high credit quality and strong returns. Second quarter student loan
volume of over $395 million continued to reflect the uncertainty around federal student loan payments. Second
quarter home loan volume of over $243 million was down 27% year-over-year, but nearly tripled sequentially, as
we began to benefit from the technology platform and overall loan capacity from our acquisition at the beginning of
the quarter.

Technology Platform Segment Results
Technology Platform segment record net revenue of $87.6 million for the second quarter of 2023 increased 4%
year-over-year and 13% sequentially, and includes strong contribution from Galileo, which had 9% sequential
revenue growth, and continued strong contribution from Technisys, which had 21% sequential revenue growth.
Contribution profit of $17.2 million decreased 21% year-over-year, for a margin of 20%, which improved modestly
from the prior quarter. We are seeing strong adoption of new products, including Konecta, our AI natural language
customer service bot, and our Payments Risk Platform (PRP), a platform which leverages transactional data to
reduce transaction fraud.

Financial Services Segment Results
Financial Services segment record net revenue increased 223% in the second quarter of 2023 to $98.1 million from
the prior year period's total of $30.4 million, helped by 188% growth in segment interchange revenue and 477%
growth in net interest income. Strength in the segment results was driven by SoFi Money along with contributions
from SoFi Invest, SoFi Protect, SoFi Credit Card, and lending-as-a-service.
Importantly, Financial Services segment contribution loss was $4.3 million, reflecting a $49.4 million improvement
over the prior-year quarter's $53.7 million loss, as well as our second consecutive quarter of positive variable profit
in the segment. This came as a result of continued improvement in monetization for the segment, along with
increasing operating leverage as we efficiently scale the business. Annualized revenue per product of $50 more than
doubled year-over-year and grew 9% sequentially.

Guidance and Outlook
Management expects to generate $1.025 to $1.085 billion of adjusted net revenue in the second half of 2023, up
19% to 26% year-over-year, and $180 to $190 million of adjusted EBITDA.
For the full year 2023, management expects adjusted net revenue of $1.974 to $2.034 billion, up from its prior
guidance of $1.955 to $2.02 billion, and full-year adjusted EBITDA of $333 to $343 million, up from its prior
guidance of $268 to $288 million, representing a 40-44% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin. Management
projects that a more significant portion of the second half adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA results will be
generated during the fourth quarter. As the company moves toward expected GAAP net income profitability in the
fourth quarter, management expects share-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses to be
slightly higher than reported second quarter 2023 levels in both the third and fourth quarters of the year.
Management will further address second half and full-year 2023 guidance on the quarterly earnings conference call.
Management has not reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP
measures of total net revenue, net income and gross margin. This is because the company cannot predict with
reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate outcome of certain GAAP components of such
reconciliations due to market-related assumptions that are not within our control as well as certain legal or advisory
costs, tax costs or other costs that may arise. For these reasons, management is unable to assess the probable
significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of the future directly
comparable GAAP measures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release presents information about our adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP
financial measures provided as supplements to the results provided in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We use adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our
operating performance, formulate business plans, help better assess our overall liquidity position, and make strategic
decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we
believe that adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. These non-GAAP
measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools, and
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the analysis of other GAAP financial measures,
such as total net revenue and net income (loss). Other companies may not use these non-GAAP measures or may
use similar measures that are defined in a different manner. Therefore, SoFi's non-GAAP measures may not be
directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures
to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in Table 2 to the “Financial Tables” herein.
Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are presented without reconciliations of such forward-looking non-
GAAP measures because the GAAP financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis and
reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and
quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments reflected in our
reconciliation of historic non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on historical experience,
could be material.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Revenue
Adjusted net revenue is defined as total net revenue, adjusted to exclude the fair value changes in servicing rights and residual
interests classified as debt due to valuation inputs and assumptions changes, which relate only to our Lending segment. For our
consolidated results and for the Lending segment, we reconcile adjusted net revenue to total net revenue, the most directly
comparable GAAP measure, as presented for the periods indicated below:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,
($ in thousands) 2023 2022 2023 2022
Total net revenue ...................................................................... $ 498,018 $ 362,527 $ 970,176 $ 692,871

___________________
(1) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on servicing rights, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. These assumptions
are highly sensitive to market interest rate changes and are not indicative of our performance or results of operations. Moreover, these non-cash charges are
unrealized during the period and, therefore, have no impact on our cash flows from operations. As such, these positive and negative changes are adjusted out of
total net revenue to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the net revenue available to finance our operations and our overall
performance.
(2) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on residual interests classified as debt, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates.
When third parties finance our consolidated securitization VIEs by purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the closing of the
securitization and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash flows to the residual interest owner. These residual debt obligations are measured at fair value on a
recurring basis, but they have no impact on our initial financing proceeds, our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest
claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the general operations of our business. As such, these positive and negative non-cash
changes in fair value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of total net revenue to provide management and financial users with better visibility
into the net revenue available to finance our operations.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude, as applicable: (i) corporate borrowing-based interest expense
(our adjusted EBITDA measure is not adjusted for warehouse or securitization-based interest expense, nor deposit interest expense
and finance lease liability interest expense, as these are not direct operating expenses), (ii) income tax expense (benefit),
(iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) share-based expense (inclusive of equity-based payments to non-employees), (v) impairment
expense (inclusive of goodwill impairment and property, equipment and software abandonments), (vi) transaction-related expenses,
(vii) fair value changes in warrant liabilities, (viii) fair value changes in each of servicing rights and residual interests classified as
debt due to valuation assumptions, and (ix) other charges, as appropriate, that are not expected to recur and are not indicative of our
core operating performance. We reconcile adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the
periods indicated below:
Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,

Adjusted EBITDA........................................................................ $ 76,819 $ 20,304 $ 152,508 $ 28,988
___________________
(1) Our adjusted EBITDA measure adjusts for corporate borrowing-based interest expense, as these expenses are a function of our capital structure. Corporate
borrowing-based interest expense includes interest on our revolving credit facility and the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs on our
convertible notes. Revolving credit facility interest expense in the 2023 periods increased due to higher interest rates relative to the prior year periods on
identical outstanding debt.
(2) Income taxes were primarily attributable to tax expense associated with the profitability of SoFi Bank in state jurisdictions where separate filings are required.
For the three and six month 2023 periods, this expense was more than offset by income tax benefits from foreign losses in jurisdictions with net deferred tax
liabilities related to Technisys.
(3) Depreciation and amortization expense for the 2023 periods increased compared to the 2022 periods primarily in connection with acquisitions and growth in
our internally-developed software balance.
(4) Restructuring charges in the six-month 2023 period primarily included employee-related wages, benefits and severance associated with a small reduction in
headcount in our Technology Platform segment in the first quarter of 2023, which do not reflect expected future operating expenses and are not indicative of
our core operating performance.
(5) Impairment expense in the six-month 2023 period relates to a sublease arrangement, which is not indicative of our core operating performance.
(6) Transaction-related expenses in the 2023 and 2022 periods included financial advisory and professional services costs associated with our acquisition of
Wyndham and Technisys, respectively.
(7) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including market servicing costs, conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. This non-cash
change is unrealized during the period and, therefore, has no impact on our cash flows from operations. As such, these positive and negative changes in fair
value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of net loss to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the earnings available
to finance our operations.
(8) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. When third parties finance our
consolidated VIEs through purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the securitization close and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash
flows to the residual interest owner. These obligations are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which has no impact on our initial financing proceeds,
our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the
general operations of our business. As such, these positive and negative non-cash changes in fair value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of
net loss to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the earnings available to finance our operations.

(1) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company included SoFi accounts on the Galileo platform-as-a-service in its total Technology Platform accounts
metric to better align with the presentation of Technology Platform segment revenue. Quarterly amounts for the earlier quarters in 2021 were determined to
be immaterial, and as such were not recast.
Members
We refer to our customers as “members”. We define a member as someone who has a lending relationship with us through
origination and/or ongoing servicing, opened a financial services account, linked an external account to our platform, or signed up
for our credit score monitoring service. Our members have continuous access to our certified financial planners, our career advice
services, our member events, our content, educational material, news, and our tools and calculators, which are provided at no cost
to the member. We view members as an indication not only of the size and a measurement of growth of our business, but also as a
measure of the significant value of the data we have collected over time.
Once someone becomes a member, they are always considered a member unless they violate our terms of service. We adjust our
total number of members in the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service. This could occur for a
variety of reasons—including fraud or pursuant to certain legal processes—and, as our terms of service evolve together with our
business practices, product offerings and applicable regulations, our grounds for removing members from our total member count
could change. The determination that a member should be removed in accordance with our terms of service is subject to an
evaluation process, following the completion, and based on the results, of which, relevant members and their associated products
are removed from our total member count in the period in which such evaluation process concludes. However, depending on the
length of the evaluation process, that removal may not take place in the same period in which the member was added to our
member count or the same period in which the circumstances leading to their removal occurred. For this reason, our total member
count may not yet reflect adjustments that may be made once ongoing evaluation processes, if any, conclude.
Total Products
Total products refers to the aggregate number of lending and financial services products that our members have selected on our
platform since our inception through the reporting date, whether or not the members are still registered for such products. Total
products is a primary indicator of the size and reach of our Lending and Financial Services segments. Management relies on total
products metrics to understand the effectiveness of our member acquisition efforts and to gauge the propensity for members to use
more than one product.
In our Lending segment, total products refers to the number of personal loans, student loans and home loans that have been
originated through our platform through the reporting date, whether or not such loans have been paid off. If a member has
multiple loan products of the same loan product type, such as two personal loans, that is counted as a single product. However, if
a member has multiple loan products across loan product types, such as one personal loan and one home loan, that is counted as
two products.
In our Financial Services segment, total products refers to the number of SoFi Money accounts (inclusive of checking and savings
accounts held at SoFi Bank and cash management accounts), SoFi Invest accounts, SoFi Credit Card accounts (including accounts
with a zero dollar balance at the reporting date), referred loans (which are originated by a third-party partner to which we provide
pre-qualified borrower referrals), SoFi At Work accounts and SoFi Relay accounts (with either credit score monitoring enabled or
external linked accounts) that have been opened through our platform through the reporting date. Checking and savings accounts
are considered one account within our total products metric. Our SoFi Invest service is composed of three products: active
investing accounts, robo-advisory accounts and digital assets accounts. Our members can select any one or combination of the
three types of SoFi Invest products. If a member has multiple SoFi Invest products of the same account type, such as two active
investing accounts, that is counted as a single product. However, if a member has multiple SoFi Invest products across account
18
types, such as one active investing account and one robo-advisory account, those separate account types are considered separate
products. In the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service, as discussed under “Members” above, the
member’s associated products are also removed.
Technology Platform Total Accounts
In our Technology Platform segment, total accounts refers to the number of open accounts at Galileo as of the reporting date.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we included intercompany accounts on the Galileo platform-as-a-service in our total
accounts metric to better align with the Technology Platform segment revenue, which includes intercompany revenue. We recast
the accounts in the fourth quarter of 2021, but did not recast the accounts for the earlier quarters in 2021, as the impact was
determined to be immaterial. Total accounts is a primary indicator of the accounts dependent upon our technology platform to use
virtual card products, virtual wallets, make peer-to-peer and bank-to-bank transfers, receive early paychecks, separate savings
from spending balances, make debit transactions and rely upon real-time authorizations, all of which result in revenues for the
Technology Platform segment. We do not measure total accounts for the Technisys products and solutions, as the revenue model
is not primarily dependent upon being a fully integrated, stand-ready service.

(1) Adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For additional information on these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures, see “Non-
GAAP Financial Measures” and Table 2 to the “Financial Tables” herein.
(2) Technology Platform segment total net revenue includes intercompany fees. The equal and offsetting intercompany expenses are reflected within the Financial Services and Technology Platform segment
directly attributable expenses. The intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation. The revenues are eliminated within Corporate/Other and the expenses represent a reconciling item of
segment contribution profit (loss) to consolidated loss before income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2021, all intercompany amounts were reflected in the fourth quarter, as inter-quarter amounts were
determined to be immaterial.
