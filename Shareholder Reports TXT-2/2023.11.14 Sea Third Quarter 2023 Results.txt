Sea Limited Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results
Singapore, November 14, 2023 – Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) (“Sea” or the “Company”) today
announced its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.
“Our strategy for e-commerce is driven by the principle that maximizing the long-term profitability
of the business will generate the greatest returns to our shareholders in the long run,” said Forrest
Li, Sea’s Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer. “And maximizing long-term profitability
requires scale and strong market leadership. To achieve this long-term objective, we look at three
key operational factors: growth, current profitability, and market share gain.”
“In this current period, we will prioritize investing in the business to increase our market share
and further strengthen our market leadership. We now have scale, a deep understanding of our
markets, and strong localized execution across diverse geographies. This gives us a wide
competitive moat, and we intend to grow it further. Our move to self-sufficiency and profitability
in the past quarters has significantly improved both our cash reserves and operational efficiency
and we see a very good opportunity to build our e-commerce content ecosystem efficiently
especially in live streaming.”
“We are committed to maintaining a strong cash position, not relying on external funding, and
investing within our means at a time and pace of our choosing. At the same time, given that e-
commerce penetration remains low in most of our markets, we as the market leader have a
responsibility to help grow the whole e-commerce ecosystem. Shopee will remain committed to
doing so in a healthy and sustainable way and driving value creation for all stakeholders.”

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help evaluate
our operating performance:
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our digital entertainment segment represents operating income (loss)
plus (a) depreciation and amortization expenses, and (b) the net effect of changes in deferred
revenue and its related cost for our digital entertainment segment. We believe that the segment
adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their
understanding of the past performance and future prospects.
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our e-commerce segment, digital financial services segment and
other services segment represents operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization
expenses. We believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends
in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future
prospects.
• “Total adjusted EBITDA” represents the sum of adjusted EBITDA of all our segments
combined, plus unallocated expenses. We believe that the total adjusted EBITDA helps to
identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past
performance and future prospects.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. None of the above
financial measures should be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to revenue, net
loss/income, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly
titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to Sea’s data. We
compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest
U.S. GAAP financial measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating our
performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on
any single financial measure.
