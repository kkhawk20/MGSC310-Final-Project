Plug Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results
with Revenue of $199M
2023 overall financial performance has been negatively impacted
by unprecedented supply challenges in the hydrogen network
in North America.
We believe this hydrogen supply challenge is a transitory issue, especially
as we expect our Georgia and Tennessee facilities to produce at full
capacity by year-end.
Lessons from ramping up our Georgia green hydrogen facility coupled
with our manufacturing ramp, diversity of products, and major new
customer wins reinforce Plug’s leadership position in the global green
hydrogen economy.
● The liquid hydrogen market in North America has been severely constrained by
multiple frequent force majeure events, leading to volume constraints which has
delayed Plug’s deployments and service margin improvements: Plug continues to
manage through a historically difficult hydrogen supply environment by leveraging our
logistics assets and team members to transport hydrogen across the US to support customer
operations as well as implementing contingency plans in various regions of the country.
Despite this challenging industry environment, we have achieved 21% sequential gross
margin improvement in 3Q 2023 compared to 2Q 2023 in our fuel business.
● Despite hydrogen supply challenges impacting overall company gross margin, we have
seen margin expansion in certain new products: Reported GAAP gross loss of (69%), was
impacted negatively by equipment sales mix, service contract loss accruals, and continued
negative fuel margins. Despite these factors, the Company saw margin expansion across
certain new product platforms.
1
● Georgia green hydrogen plant nearing major milestone: We are completing the final step
of the commissioning process for the liquefiers/cold box. Liquid production is anticipated
between November 15th and year-end. Also, developments at Louisiana, Texas and New York
are expected to provide an additional step change in our
fuel margin expansion. Our gas plant in Georgia has now
been operating for almost a year supporting high
pressure tube trailer filling for Plug as well as other
customers. Unprecedented hydrogen supply challenges
in the US only further reinforces our vertically integrated
strategy and need for a resilient generation network to
support multiple applications.
● Electrolyzer sales grew greater than three times
quarter over quarter. Multiple large-scale orders
validate Plug’s position as a go-to electrolyzer supplier
for industrial scale projects: Since our second quarter 2023 call, Plug has line of sight to an
additional 1 GW of electrolyzer orders to our backlog, including 550 MW for Fortescue in
Australia and 280 MW for Arcadia e-Fuels in Denmark.
● Liquefier and cryogenics business continues rapid growth - sales pipeline now
exceeding $1.1B: Plug’s cryogenics and liquefier business revenue increased approximately
three times year over year (YoY), while margins have expanded by an even greater
improvement in the same period.
● Average sales cycle continues to accelerate in our material handling business given the
value proposition of our product and increased market awareness of our solutions. Recently,
Plug has added multiple global customers including Tyson,
Ryder, STEF and others.
● Large-scale stationary manufacturing is ramping up,
with first units operating at customer sites: Stationary
power manufacturing lines are commissioned, with
customer orders increasing across EV charging, data
centers, and microgrid opportunities. Plug is on track to
deliver multiple units in the fourth quarter of 2023, with
expected substantial growth in 2024 and beyond.
2
● Service accrual charge reflects higher near-term cost projections, which have been
impacted by delay in roll out of certain reliability investments: In the third quarter of
2023, the Company has incurred a non-cash charge of $41.6 million. This charge reflects the
projection for future costs to service our existing fleet through the remainder of their service
contract. The severe hydrogen shortages have negatively affected direct cost of service as
well as the timing for implementation of fleet upgrades into customer operated equipment.
These factors have been compounded by certain cost increases from inflation impacts on
labor, materials and overhead. The Company is continuing to monitor the current cost trends
and hydrogen market dynamics. If these trends continue, the Company may have to record
additional service loss provisions in future periods.
● Plug’s Gigafactory and Vista facilities represent global manufacturing excellence that
we believe will create a sustainable competitive advantage and industry cost
leadership: Plug has increased our manufacturing footprint from 50 thousand sq. ft. to
nearly 1 million sq. ft. With minimal additional capital investment, Plug believes it can
significantly expand our manufacturing capacity to meet anticipated demand while
delivering continued manufacturing cost reduction.
As Plug manages through short-term hydrogen supply disruption,
we are focused on operational scale, in-house hydrogen
generation and policy tailwinds to further the Company's position
as a global leader in the green hydrogen industry.
We believe four key business accelerators position the Company to dramatically change our
operations and financials in coming quarters, following what have been unprecedented challenges
that have arisen from hydrogen supply disruptions in 2023.
1. Business Expansion:
● Diverse New Product Platforms: Electrolyzers, liquefiers, cryogenics, and new fuel cell
applications are beginning to become an increasing share of our revenue while we continue to
add multiple large customers in our material handling business. Business opportunities remain
robust, and expansion of these platforms will be instrumental in achieving our top line growth,
but more importantly establishes a clear path to margin expansion and profitability.
● Large Scale Electrolyzer Customers: Over 1 GW of new electrolyzer opportunities, including
Fortescue and Arcadia, illustrate how Plug’s scale and technology are equating to industrial-
scale electrolyzer orders.
3
● Partnerships Reaching Scale Globally: Plug and SK’s current activities include the use of
products across our entire platform. AccionaPlug is progressing the 15TPD plant in Spain. Hyvia
joint venture (JV) is well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2024 and beyond, with multiple
test pilots ongoing and fuel cell vans available for commercial use today.
2. Margin Enhancement Roadmaps:
● Hydrogen Generation: Fuel margin rate improved by 21% sequentially from Q2 2023. Margin
improvement was achieved despite numerous force majeure events within the hydrogen
network that impacted as much as one-third of the US liquid hydrogen supply. Plug's logistics
capabilities and contingency plans have allowed us to manage this difficult environment. We
expect this is transitory as we expect Georgia and Tennessee facilities to come on-line by
year-end. We believe we have effectively managed this situation considering hydrogen pricing
has reached over $30/kg on the West Coast.
● Manufacturing Scale: Plug has already established a world-class manufacturing presence
with the ability to meaningfully expand manufacturing capacity with minimal or no additional
capital expenditure. This sets the stage for continued cost reduction.
● Simplifying Designs and Improving Performance: Service cost improvements remain a key
focus area for the Company in order to drive overall margin within the material handling
business. As part of this effort, Plug has deployed several fleet wide initiatives in 2023
implementing upgrades for in service equipment that will improve power density, reliability,
and life of the fuel cell components in material handling applications. Equipment upgrades
include a combination of software operability improvements as well as new hardware. Plug
continues to target 30% per unit service cost decrease over the
medium-term, as we see the results of these enhancements, continued increase of the fleet
mix to latest technology, release of new product stack platforms with higher power density,
and the rollout of power upgrades planned for 2024.
3. Future Funding Roadmaps: Given our forecasted capital expenditure and operating
requirements under the current business plan, and the Company’s existing cash and liquidity
position, the Company will need to access additional capital in the market to fund its activities.
The Company is pursuing a number of debt capital and project financing solutions.
● Corporate Debt Solutions: We are evaluating varied debt financing solutions to support our
growth.
● US Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Program: Currently, Plug is working towards a
conditional commitment from the DOE Loan Program Office to finance plants in our green
hydrogen network.
● Project Finance and Plant Equity Partners: Our MOU with Fortescue contemplates Fortescue
having a 40% equity stake in Plug’s Texas hydrogen plant and for Plug to take up to a 25%
equity stake in Fortescue’s Phoenix hydrogen plant. We will continue to evaluate partners to
lower our capital expenditure needs.
4
4. Policy and Regulations:
● Guidance for the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Production Tax Credit (PTC) is expected
before year-end: We believe that the guidance will be beneficial to the development of Plug’s
green hydrogen platform, serve as a catalyst for final investment decisions (FIDs) on multiple
hydrogen projects, and support future deployments of our fuel cell units and systems.
● Hydrogen Hubs: The DOE announced $7 Billion for Regional Hydrogen Hubs. Plug is engaged
in all seven hubs and a corporate sponsor in five of the announced hubs. This involvement,
along with Plug’s expansive product portfolio, sets up the Company to play a substantial role
in these programs.
● EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED): RED mandates renewable hydrogen use in transport,
industry, buildings, and district heating and cooling, with targets of 42% green hydrogen by
2030 and 60% by 2035 in the European Union (EU). The adoption of this policy, along with the
Net Zero Industry Act and Hydrogen Bank pilot auctions, represents meaningful government
incentives to accelerate hydrogen adoption across the region.
Green Hydrogen Generation Network and Plant Updates
Our Georgia plant represents a first-of-a-kind facility, which has come with invaluable learnings.
Some of the key lessons learned are already benefiting Plug as we are building additional plants in
various locations.
● Improved contracting strategy: We have been able to secure a lump sum contract for
engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) work at our Texas plant. This will
meaningfully reduce construction capital expenditures versus the “time & materials”
contract employed in Georgia.
● EPC scope of work: Turnkey contracts include the entire scope of the plant, ensuring
continuity and timeliness of plant construction.
● Procedure development: The project execution team has been able to optimize construction
and commissioning procedures based on experience with each plant component in Georgia.
● Construction team members and facility oversight: The team has identified multiple key
positions to lead construction and commissioning activities across our network to ensure
efficient installation of key components. This includes lead mechanical supervisors and
additional electrical and instrumentation engineers.
● Timeline management for first-of-kind projects: Timelines at Georgia, and key changes
listed above, allow our project execution timelines to have lower risk and greater oversight,
ensuring completion of future plants on targeted timelines.
5
In light of these learnings, we are also updating schedules for current plants under construction.
US Green Hydrogen Network:
Georgia: We are completing the final step of the commissioning process for the
liquefiers/cold box. Liquid production is anticipated between November 15th and year-end.
Olin JV - Louisiana: Construction continues with site grading, with the turnkey provider
mobilizing for installation of the liquefaction package in November. The commissioning plan
has been developed to ensure a smooth process from construction through commissioning
and start-up.
Texas: Construction began at the site with our hydrogen facility EPC contractor, Kiewit. Work
is ongoing for on-site grading, access roads, the power transmission line, and on-site
substation.
Alabama, New York: We continue to work in collaboration with New York Power Authority
and National Grid to complete and energize the substation, which remains the gating item to
achieve the full 74 TPD capacity in the first half of 2025.
Other Projects: Plug is actively evaluating several sites for potential new or expanded
production capabilities, with a focus on achieving up to 45 TPD of liquid hydrogen output.
6
European Green Hydrogen Network:
Port of Antwerp: We expect all permits to be obtained in
2024, which would allow it to move to the construction
phase in the course of the following year. Meanwhile,
conversations with off-takers are progressing, with the
plant’s targeted production already oversubscribed by
over tenfold.
Acciona JV: The JV is actively advancing the development
of our first three projects, which target curtailed renewable
energy sources. This will be the first 15 MW green
hydrogen plant in Spain, which we expect to be on track for
commissioning in the latter half of 2024.
Finland: Feasibility studies are being finalized, with the aim to start the next engineering
phase in the first quarter of 2024. The plants aim for a total capacity of 850 TPD, with FID
expected by 2026.
Other Projects: Plug is developing small-scale sites throughout Europe, driven by Plug
customers' demand for hydrogen, notably in the United Kingdom and Germany.
Plug continues to capture large-scale projects globally, with IRA
guidance as a potential catalyst for project FIDs in the US
We continue to track new orders in our previously disclosed 7.5 GW pipeline of near-term projects
approaching FID.
● Arcadia eFuels has selected Plug to provide a 280 MW electrolyzer system to Arcadia’s
Vordingborg plant for the production of sustainable aviation fuel.
7
● Plug is the preferred supplier of 550 MW electrolyzers for Fortescue’s proposed Gibson
Island Project. The plant is expected to produce approximately 385,000 metric tons of green
ammonia a year.
The near-term focus of customers remains on industrial applications. Low-carbon mandates in the
EU, hydrogen PTC in the US, and other low carbon fuel standards globally are driving investment.
Plug’s experience across our plant network and with customers has allowed continuous optimization
of our offering for industrial scale plant customers.
Cryogenics and Liquefier Business Delivers Strong Revenue
Growth and Further Product Diversification
Cryogenics solutions and liquefier sales contributed $35.4 million to Q3 revenue. The sales pipeline
includes up to $1.1B of opportunities, including multiple programs that may be able to begin revenue
recognition in the fourth quarter of 2023, depending on contract timing. We anticipate bookings and
revenue will continue to be lumpy in the near-term while we pursue these opportunities and seek to
build our liquefier backlog.
8
Customer Demand in High-Power Stationary Application
Creates Significant Hydrogen Offtake Opportunities
Plug commissioned our first high-power stationary units in the field in the third quarter of 2023 and
expects the business to continue growing in 2024 and beyond. A variety of end users for this product
are creating a large sales pipeline for both the stationary products and hydrogen offtake.
EV Charging: 1 – 5 MW of additional power for a site is needed for EV fleets, creating
challenges with grid availability, upgrade costs, and electricity pricing swings. Our application
solves time to power, cost of power, and reliability issues, while demanding up to 1TPD+ of
hydrogen for a 1 MW unit.
Micro-grids and Peaker Plants: Hydrogen for large-scale (1 MW – 1 GW+) backup power and
peak power is gaining traction as grid intermittency and physical limits of battery backup
make alternatives difficult. Hydrogen can address both scalability and duration for sites with
backup power needs beyond 6-8 hours.
Data Center Prime and Peak Power: Growing demand for cloud and AI processing is
stressing grid capacity globally. Plug's value proposition for data centers includes time to
power, limited impact to current data center architecture, true zero-emissions, and 100%
renewable matching.
Material Handling Customer Diversity is Driving
Broad-Based Growth
Our pedestal customers are continuing to grow their business in the US and Europe, with 11 total
pedestal customers in the US and Europe. Plug remains focused on improving service and power
purchase agreement margins for material handling and is executing internal initiatives to drive costs
down as we scale our business.
Plug’s newest pedestal customer, Tyson, showed overwhelmingly positive results when analyzing
their business case for integrating Plug’s fuel cells. This included a 13-15% productivity gain, 17M
pounds of estimated carbon footprint reduction annually, and 50,000 annual labor hours saved
across eight sites.
9
A driving factor in our global material handling growth is the reduction in product lead times from
our new manufacturing sites, coupled with the maturity of our solution following years of successful
implementation. The sales cycle has decreased meaningfully given the value proposition of our
product and we have added multiple customers including Tyson, Ryder and STEF.
World-Class Global Manufacturing Facilities
Drive Operating Leverage
The Innovation Center and Gigafactory in Rochester, NY reached its initial nameplate capacity of 100
MW of electrolyzer stacks per month in May 2023. The factory design allows for continued expansion
and automation, which will enable Plug to drive down costs and increase throughput over time with
additional equipment. The Company plans to organically expand its proton exchange membrane
(PEM) stack manufacturing capacity in Rochester well beyond 2.5 GW per year. We believe this could
result in greater than 4 GW of electrolyzer capacity, and over 200,000 fuel cell stacks produced per
year by 2030.
Additionally, we are nearing completion on the balance of the manufacturing lines at our Vista Fuel
Cell Manufacturing facility in Slingerlands, NY. The Vista facility spans 407,000 square feet, with the
ability to expand to 800,000 square feet to meet the growing demand for our fuel cell products. This
massive expansion in Plug’s fuel cell manufacturing for material handling represents a four-fold
increase YoY. The site targets capacity by 2030 to produce 80,000 GenDrive units, 500 MW of 1-3 MW
stationary power units, and 20,000 ProGen engines.
Summary of Third Quarter Financials
Revenue was $199M in the quarter, compared to $189M for the third quarter of 2022, up 5% YoY.
Overall, company gross margin was negative 69%, compared to negative 24% for the third quarter
of 2022. The equipment line item now consists of a blended margin from established fuel cell
applications in the material handling sector and our rapidly expanding new product lines such as
electrolyzers, on-road mobility solutions, stationary power units, cryogenic equipment, and
liquefiers.
The unprecedented number of hydrogen facilities in the market running below nameplate capacity
has caused significant hydrogen shortages impacting deployment schedules, fuel prices, system
10
efficiencies, service on hydrogen infrastructures, and timing of varied reliability program rollouts.
The network has seen improvement recently, and we expect liquid hydrogen production from both
the Georgia and Tennessee facilities will have substantial impacts on network disruptions.
Service costs have been affected as hydrogen disruptions have delayed the roll out of upgrades at
both new and existing customer sites. These factors have been compounded by certain cost
increases from inflation impacts on labor, materials and overhead. Upgrades in the field also take a
period of time to create meaningful cost improvements, as aging units in the field continue to require
additional service. In the interim, given the impact on service and near-term cost projections, we
have recorded additional service loss accrual for open contracts. Improvements to our service
margin profile are planned to be addressed through the roll out of a new GenDrive platform in 2024,
continued upgrades at existing facilities, and operational continuity from lower hydrogen supply
disruptions.
