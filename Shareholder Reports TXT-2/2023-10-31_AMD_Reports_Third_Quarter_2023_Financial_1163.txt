AMD Reports Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results
SANTA CLARA, Calif. ― Oct. 31, 2023 ― AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) today announced revenue for the
third quarter of 2023 of $5.8 billion, gross margin of 47%, operating income of $224 million, net income of
$299 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.18. On a non-GAAP(*) basis, gross margin was 51%,
operating income was $1.3 billion, net income was $1.1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $0.70.
“We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth driven by demand for our Ryzen 7000 series
PC processors and record server processor sales,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Our data
center business is on a significant growth trajectory based on the strength of our EPYC CPU portfolio and
the ramp of Instinct MI300 accelerator shipments to support multiple deployments with hyperscale,
enterprise and AI customers.”
“We executed well in the third quarter, delivering year-over-year growth in revenue, gross margin
and earnings per share,” said AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer Jean Hu. “In the fourth quarter, we expect to
see strong growth in Data Center and continued momentum in Client, partially offset by lower sales in the
Gaming segment and additional softening of demand in the embedded markets.”

Quarterly Segment Summary
• Data Center segment revenue was $1.6 billion, flat year-over-year, as growth in 4th Gen AMD
EPYC™ CPU sales was offset by a decline in adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) data center
products.
o Revenue increased 21% sequentially as customer adoption of 4th Gen AMD EPYC CPUs
accelerated during the quarter.
o AMD Instinct™ MI300A and MI300X GPUs are on track for volume production in the fourth

• Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 42% year-over-year driven primarily by higher Ryzen
mobile processor sales.
o Revenue grew 46% sequentially driven by an increase in AMD Ryzen™ 7000 Series CPU
sales.

(*) In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including non-
GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings
per share. AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across
the reporting periods. For fiscal 2023, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-
GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental
non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the
end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it
easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors
in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative
of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial
measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s
reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial
Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-
looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of October 31, 2023 and
assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin outlook typically
include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related and other costs. The timing and
impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a
reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or
revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by
adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-
based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense (including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles), acquisition-related and
other costs. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders
in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it
believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the
Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be
consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an
alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.

The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by
adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a
percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release
because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free
cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view
free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.
