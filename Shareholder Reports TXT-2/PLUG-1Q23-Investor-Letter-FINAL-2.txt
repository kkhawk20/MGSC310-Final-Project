Plug Reports $210.3MM in Revenue,
up 49% Year Over Year
Reaffirming 2023 Targets, focused on key initiatives to enable
revenue growth and path to profitability
● Plug’s Georgia Liquid Green Hydrogen Plant Will Complete Commissioning and
Continue to Ramp to Liquid Production throughout Q2: The plant has been brought online
in less than a year since issuing the full EPC contract (engineering, procurement and
construction contract), marking a new industry standard for the construction timeline of a
liquid hydrogen plant. Gaseous hydrogen production has continued at the Georgia plant,
with fills of our fleet of high-pressure tube trailers and customer trailers.
● Green Hydrogen Buildout on Track: Leveraging learnings from Georgia, we have been able
to negotiate a lump sum turnkey construction contract for our Texas plant, and we have
selected an EPC management company for New York. We are also working on optimizing our
project execution strategy in Louisiana with our JV partner. Lastly, the decision on the location
of our next plant is in the final stages. We believe these activities put us on track to reach 200
tons-per-day (TPD) under construction and/or commissioning by the end of 2023.
● Electrolyzer Sales Opportunities Expanding Globally: Deliveries into our 2 giga-watt (GW)
backlog in 2023 range across large-scale projects and 1-5 megawatt (MW) containerized
solutions. Meaningful traction with our containerized 5MW electrolyzer system continues in
both the U.S. and Europe, including multiple repeat orders. We are also at the final stages of
negotiating large-scale project opportunities in the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific representing
potential bookings over 1GW.
● Large-Scale Stationary Offering Creates Substantial Revenue Growth Opportunity: Plug
continues to see strong demand from electric vehicle (EV) fleet owners given their grid
constraints. The different applications for Plug’s stationary power, including data center
back-up and prime power, represent up to a trillion-dollar market opportunity. The first units
are being deployed in Q2 2023.
● Scaling New Production Facilities; Gigafactory on Track to Produce 100MW of
Electrolyzer per Month by Mid-Q2: We have now produced more 1MW stacks in Q1 2023
than all of 2022. Our Vista fuel cell manufacturing facility in Slingerlands, NY is now producing
1
all GenDrive units for material handling, and we are underway in commissioning the first
high-power stationary power manufacturing line.
● Material Handling Signs New Pedestal Customer STEF in France, Growth remains
Robust: STEF is one of the leading cold logistics companies in Europe. Plug is on track to add
multiple new pedestal customers in 2023, with plans to deploy in total over 12,000 GenDrive
units and 80 new customer sites in 2023.
● Multiple Non-dilutive Financing Opportunities Available to Support Anticipated
Powerful Growth and the Buildout of our Green Hydrogen Network: Plug is evaluating
several financing options with counterparties, including but not limited to, the Department
of Energy (DOE) Loan Program, strategic project investment partners, and asset-backed loan
(ABL) facilities from major banks. Between the current cash position, a $5.7B balance sheet,
and interest from multiple capital partners, we believe Plug is well positioned to fund
forecasted growth.
● Progress on 2023 Objectives Mark an Inflection Point for Plug: Green hydrogen
production, manufacturing scale, electrolyzer sales, fuel cell product growth and progress on
other 2023 objectives have positioned Plug to achieve significant revenue and continued
margin expansion throughout the year.
Plug’s Integrated Model and Strategic Priorities Position Company
to Achieve Milestone Growth
Plug’s speed of execution in our first-of-its-kind green hydrogen plants and commercialized fuel cell
products remains unmatched. Our learnings from this journey continue to be invaluable as the
company engages in multiple significant business activities, many of which are approaching
inflection points. With an expected $10T addressable market by 2050, and multibillion-dollar
opportunities in the near-term across our various product lines. Plug remains fully committed to
executing on our strategic priorities in three key business units:
● Plug Energy: Our vertically integrated hydrogen platform strategy has established Plug
as a one-stop shop for capital equipment to produce, liquefy, store, and transport
hydrogen. The buildout of our global green hydrogen network allows customers to
seamlessly integrate hydrogen into their operations across multiple industries.
2
Investments to build these capabilities should allow Plug to drive significant revenue
through equipment portfolio sales, and hydrogen fuel delivery to customers.
● Plug Fuel Cell Applications: We have a track record of innovation in developing industry-
leading fuel cell applications for stationary power and mobility, drawing on our
experience in material handling. Plug’s technology provides high-efficiency, carbon-free
power to a wide range of applications, making it suitable for meeting the decarbonization
goals of various industries. As Plug continues to innovate, it remains at the forefront of
the next generation of fuel cell applications.
● Manufacturing: Plug continues to expand our industry leading manufacturing
capabilities and supply chains to support exponential growth and cost-down roadmaps.
Plug has a powerful combination of fuel cell products and top-notch hydrogen energy capabilities,
which creates a strong flywheel effect. This effect multiplies demand and accelerates the adoption of
fuel cell technology and hydrogen across various end markets. As a result, Plug can leverage
portfolio sales opportunities and drive exponential growth. The investments made into this platform
positions Plug strongly at a time when the global hydrogen economy is gaining unprecedented policy
support. Plug’s unique capabilities and customer base provide us with an exceptional perspective on
the trajectory and forthcoming acceleration of the hydrogen economy. Consequently, Plug intends

2023 Roadmap
1. Gigafactory reaches full capacity of 100MW per month of electrolyzer stacks
2. Georgia plant reaches 15TPD of liquid hydrogen production
3. Project development and execution at Louisiana hydrogen plant
4. Commissioning and constructing an additional 150-170TPD of hydrogen plants to reach 200TPD target
5. Stationary power manufacturing line begins production at Vista facility and first commercial deliveries
take place
6. 80+ material handling sites and additional pedestal customers
7. Electrolyzer backlog growth with Plug winning large-scale project mandates globally
8. Continue sales momentum and backlog growth in liquefier and cryogenic businesses
Green Hydrogen Generation Network Updates
We expect to commission 200+ TPD by 4Q23 / 1Q24 and 500TPD by year-end 2025. Based on
learnings in Georgia, presently it takes six months to get plants from commissioning to full
production. Plug’s green hydrogen generation network buildout should accelerate the energy
transition while driving meaningful margin enhancement for Plug. To clarify the impact of this
strategy, with a forecasted full year average customer demand of 65 tons of hydrogen fuel delivered
per day in 2023, Plug would be able to achieve $100 million of gross margin improvement annually
by sourcing all hydrogen internally from our plant network. We expect further gross margin
expansion toward our financial targets as additional green hydrogen plants come online in 2024 and
beyond.

Georgia: Plug has made significant strides in ramping up liquid hydrogen production, with plans to
begin production in the second quarter of 2023. In less than a year since the arrival of crews on site,
Plug is set to launch the first green hydrogen production plant in the United States, breaking the
industry standard timeline of 48 months. All the major equipment, components, and systems,
including liquefaction, Plug electrolyzers, rectifiers, liquid hydrogen storage tanks, and power
distribution centers, have been delivered and installed. The power loop has been tested and
commissioned, with all eight 5MW Plug electrolyzers already well into commissioning. Plug has also
successfully completed the commissioning and energizing of its mini-substation plant infrastructure,
and is currently producing green hydrogen from its 5MW gas plant. Furthermore, we are fulfilling
high-pressure tube trailer fills for multiple customers. Plug is in the design phase of expanding the
liquid production capability of the Georgia plant from 15TPD to 30TPD.
5
This plant represents a major achievement as Plug is turning on the first commercial scale green
hydrogen plant in the United States. Learnings from the construction and commercial operations at
Georgia are proving to be invaluable as Plug optimizes future plant design, progresses with
prospective electrolyzer customers, and diligence with strategic partners.
Olin JV - Louisiana: Plug and Olin announced the launch of a 50/50 JV to begin construction of a
15TPD hydrogen plant in Louisiana. This site broke ground in Q1 2023 and continues to make solid
progress with Plug and Olin collaborating on engineering and procurement at the facility. Key
construction and commissioning activities are planned to take place during the remainder of 2023.
Alabama, New York: We continue to make progress on our green hydrogen plant in New York to
reach 75TPD of capacity to start commissioning in Q4 2023. We have identified an EPC management
company for the plant, allowing for construction to commence. Large cryogenic storage is on site,
mini-substation construction has begun, with deliveries of rectifiers and PDCs expected in the early
summer 2023, and liquefiers and electrolyzers in Q4 2023. Permits related to the substation are now
in place, and we are working in collaboration with NYPA and National Grid to energize the substation
in the first half of 2024 to achieve liquid production.
Texas: The 45TPD plant in Texas broke ground in Q4 2022. All permits are in place, and long lead time
items are scheduled to be completed well before commissioning. On-site activities are picking up as
the company has negotiated a lump sum turnkey contract for the plant’s construction. The 345MW
wind farm that will power this plant is already operational, and we are targeting liquid hydrogen
production mid-year 2024.
Other Projects: Plug is in the process of evaluating multiple sites for either new or expanded
production for up to 45TPD of liquid hydrogen production.

Electrolyzer Pipeline Expansion to Convert into Significant Revenue
Growth in Coming Quarter
Plug’s sales funnel for electrolyzers stands at more than $30 billion with approximately 50% of that
related to e-fuels, including green ammonia and methanol. Our backlog is in excess of 2GW across
large-scale projects and 1-5MW containerized solutions, positioning Plug to deliver a breakout year
in our electrolyzer business in 2023. We expect revenue in 2023 will be driven by a mix of 1-5MW
containerized solutions and executing on existing large-scale projects primarily in the US and Europe.
In addition, the booking outlook in 2023 remains robust both for our electrolyzer product and project
business. We are seeing a meaningful order book for our 5MW containerized product both in the US
and European markets, including sizable orders from existing customers. We are also at the final
stages of negotiating large-scale project opportunities in the US, Europe and Asia-Pacific
representing potential bookings over 1GW. Plug’s learnings from our Georgia plant, development at
our other green hydrogen sites, and manufacturing scale should provide us with a unique
competitive advantage as we partner with our customers on these substantial electrolyzer
opportunities across various end markets.

Plug’s Fuel Cell Stationary Application Sees First Commercial
Operations in 2023
Plug has been actively developing its large-scale stationary products, with back-up power, green EV
charging, and prime power applications representing significant addressable markets. In 2023, we
plan to deploy over 20MW of these products.
Moreover, we see significant demand for our green hydrogen in the application of a 1MW stationary
unit for applications that have insufficient grid power, such as power fleet electric vehicles. We
anticipate that this application will not only create immediate sales opportunities but also a
continuous revenue stream for green hydrogen. Many of these applications use up to 1T of green
hydrogen per day.
8
Our largest market opportunity is in utility-scale grid support, and we are expanding our business
with utilities interested in this solution. We have long-term plans to use stationary units as both prime
power and peaker plants. The anticipated rapid growth of global green hydrogen production would
allow for the quick integration of fuel cell stationary power into the global prime and peak power
market. Through our partnership with SK Group, SK Plug Hyverse, we plan to deploy 200MW or more
per year of stationary products in South Korea for this purpose.
We are deploying the first units in the second quarter.
Material Handling Continues Expansion, Signs New Pedestal
Customer STEF, and Launches Turnkey Solution for Midsize Fleets
Pedestal customers are continuing to grow their
business in the US and Europe, with plans for
more than 80 new sites in 2023. Plug is also
having conversations with non-pedestal
customers about expanding their footprint with
GenDrive technology and is targeting three new
pedestal accounts in North America in 2023.
9
Additionally, Plug is pleased to announce signing STEF as a new pedestal customer out of France.
Plug plans on two sites with STEF in 2023. STEF is the European leader for temperature sensitive
logistics, operating for nearly 100 years at the heart of the food supply chain. STEF plans to begin
with installation of one site in Paris, France and another in Madrid, Spain, before expanding further
into their network of over 100 sites. Plug has plans for eight new sites with European customers in
2023. The company continues to target at least one additional European pedestal customer in the
coming year.
Furthermore, Plug has expanded its GenKey
offering to enable fuel cell adoption for
warehouses that operate fewer than 100 electric
forklifts. This move has grown the material
handling total available market by 1 million
forklifts through the deployment of the
Company’s new lower-cost solution. The new
offering includes several benefits, including low-
cost green hydrogen supply from Plug’s
hydrogen production plants, a modular and more
flexible hydrogen storage solution, and freedom
from grid constraints.
World-Class Global Manufacturing Facilities Reaching Full Capacity
in the Near-Term
Plug is actively expanding our manufacturing and supply chain capabilities to support anticipated
growth and drive down costs. Our industry-leading facilities allow us to achieve economies of scale,
resulting in lower per unit costs as we continue to execute our strategy and grow exponentially.
The Innovation Center and Gigafactory in Rochester, NY is already online and ramping up production
towards its annual run rate of 2.5GW of total capacity and 1.5GW of electrolyzer capacity. The factory
is expected to reach its 100MW per month target for electrolyzers in May 2023. The factory design
allows for continued expansion and automation, which will enable Plug to drive down costs and
increase throughput over time with additional equipment. The company plans to organically expand
its PEM stack manufacturing capacity in Rochester beyond 2.5GW per year.
10
Additionally, we are nearing completion on the balance of the manufacturing lines at our Vista Fuel
Cell Manufacturing Facility in Slingerlands, NY. We began manufacturing GenDrive fuel cell systems
at Vista in Q4 2022 and expect to soon finish the manufacturing line for our stationary product. Our
advanced automation allows for increased scale and efficiency in the assembly of our entire fuel cell
product line. The Vista facility will span 350,000 square feet, with the ability to expand to 1 million
square feet to meet the growing demand for our fuel cell products.
Plug Europe: Building Plug’s Hydrogen Ecosystem
Momentum in Europe continues with key activities positioning Plug as the leader in turnkey
hydrogen solutions in the EU. Multiple developments across Plug’s business units highlight the
growing demand in the European market for green hydrogen and fuel cell applications.
Key activities include:
● Uniper has selected Plug to supply electrolyzers for Uniper’s Maasvlakte site at the Port of
Rotterdam. Uniper will commission 100MW of Plug electrolyzer capacity by 2026, expanding
that capacity to 500MW by 2030.
● Plug has delivered three containerized electrolyzers to Andrea Ganzair, marking its first
delivered electrolyzer systems in the EU.
● Plug is a member of the GravitHy consortium, which aims to create a 2Mt per year direct
reduced iron plant in the south of France. The project may require up to 650MW of
electrolyzer capacity to support its operations.
11
● Plug is actively developing three projects in Spain
and Portugal as part of its JV with ACCIONA,
including the site of its first green hydrogen
production plant in Spain, scheduled to
commission in 2H 2024.
● Plug is making progress on its 35TPD green
hydrogen plant at the Port of Antwerp, with
inbound interest exceeding 10 times the plant's
capacity.
● Plug's 50/50 JV with Renault, HYVIA, successfully
completed homologation of the FCEV version of
the Master Van. The JV plans to ship up to 500 FCEV-LCVs to customers in 2023 and sell 100,000
vehicles cumulatively by 2030. In Q1 2023, Plug and HYVIA deployed an onsite containerized
electrolyzer to produce hydrogen for vehicle testing.
● Plug is evaluating potential project sites in multiple locations with low-cost renewable
electricity to produce low-cost green hydrogen and transport it to demand centers across the
EU to support decarbonization efforts.
Summary of First Quarter Financials
Revenue was $210.3M in the first quarter of 2023, compared to $140.8M for the first quarter of 2022.
Overall, company gross margin of negative 33% increased 3% sequentially, and was down 8% year
over year. Gross margin on equipment, related infrastructure and other was 13% in the first quarter,
up 3% sequentially. Plug delivered 62MW of electrolyzers in Q1 of 2023, more than all of 2022, while
adding 14 material handling sites. The equipment line item now consists of a blended margin from
both more mature fuel cell applications for the material handling business, as well as rapidly scaling
new product lines including electrolyzers, on road mobility, stationary power and cryogenic
equipment and liquefiers. Given continued ramping at our new manufacturing facilities, the
Company experienced higher fixed costs absorption in the quarter. We expect to see continuous
improvement throughout the year as we reach full production capacity at our new manufacturing
sites.
As expected, fuel margin remained under pressure due to increased hydrogen molecule cost
associated with historically higher natural gas prices and continued supplier disruptions. Cost of
fuel per kg delivered by third parties was down 13% sequentially in the first quarter of 2023,
12
and we expect this downward trend and tailwind to continue in the balance of the year as natural
gas has remained below $3. This dynamic, along with our green hydrogen plant commissioning gives
us increasing confidence in the margin improvement expected for fuel delivered to customers.
Capital and Financing Strategy
Plug is evaluating multiple sources of low-cost and non-dilutive capital, as it continues to build out a
global green hydrogen generation network. Currently, Plug is completing the second stage of due
diligence with the DOE Loan Program Office. Concurrently, we are evaluating asset-backed loan (ABL)
facilities from major banks. Finally, Plug continues to receive interest from strategic partners and
infrastructure funds regarding interest to partner in our hydrogen plants, which could help
accelerate our next generation of hydrogen plant development. Financing decisions around these
opportunities will likely be made in the second half of this year. Plug has a strong unleveraged
balance sheet and a profitable green hydrogen project pipeline which collectively create a strong
liquidity position, giving us a significant runway to continue our plant buildout and scale our
business. Longer-term capital needs are likely to be covered with operating cash flow and traditional
project financing as the company and the green hydrogen industry continue to grow.
Delivering on 2023 Roadmap and Margin Expansion Remains Key
Corporate Focus
Plug remains focused on building a global green hydrogen ecosystem and delivering on its growth
objectives, margin expansion and path to profitability. We look forward to updating you all on our
next call.
