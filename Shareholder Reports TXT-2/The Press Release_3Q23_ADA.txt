A We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (KPIs) that management uses when assessing consolidated and/or segment results. We believe
this information is useful because it provides management and investors with information about underlying operational performance and trends. KPIs are presented in
Consolidated and Business Segment Highlights on page 1, Balance Sheet, Liquidity, and Capital Highlights on page 9 and on the Segment pages for each segment.
B We also measure NII on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management
believes provides investors with meaningful information on the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of
amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. NII on an FTE basis was $14.5 billion, $14.3 billion and $13.9 billion for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $153 million, $135 million and $106 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively.
C Reserve Build (or Release) is calculated by subtracting net charge-offs for the period from the provision for credit losses recognized in that period. The period-end
allowance, or reserve, for credit losses reflects the beginning of the period allowance adjusted for net charge-offs recorded in that period plus the provision for credit
losses and other valuation accounts recognized in that period.
D Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, inclusive of U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency
mortgage-backed securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and other investment-grade securities, and are readily available to
meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity
among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions.
E Regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2023 are preliminary. The Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches.
Capital adequacy is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The
Corporation’s binding ratio was the Common equity tier 1 ratio under the Standardized approach for June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022; and Total capital ratio under
the Standardized approach for September 30, 2023.
F The below table includes Global Markets sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of
measures that exclude this item is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our
businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

were $(13) million, $(97) million and $(15) million, and Equities net DVA gains (losses) were $(3) million, $(5) million and $1 million, respectively.
G Pretax, pre-provision income (PTPI) at the consolidated level, as well as at the segment level, is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting the respective
entity’s pretax income to add back provision for credit losses. Management believes that PTPI (both at the consolidated and segment level) is a useful financial
measure as it enables an assessment of the Company’s ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle and provides an additional basis for
comparing the Company's results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods. For
Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see page 19 for Total company and below for segments.

(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides
additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation
to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 19.
(2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation.
(3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by
agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate, and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option.
(4) Regulatory capital ratios at September 30, 2023 are preliminary. Bank of America Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated

Standardized approach for June 30, 2023 and September 2022; and Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach for September 30, 2023.
(5) Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders’ equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common shareholders’ equity divided by period-end
tangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present
measures of those assets that can generate income. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 19.

(1) FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used by management in operating the business that management believes provides investors with
meaningful information on the interest margin for comparative purposes. The Corporation believes that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-
exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income includes FTE adjustments of $422 million and $315 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
and 2022, $153 million and $135 million for the third and second quarters of 2023, and $106 million for the third quarter of 2022.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
The Corporation evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common
shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common
shareholders’ equity). Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted
average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets (total assets less goodwill
and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities). Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income as
a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value
per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of
equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related financial measures defined by GAAP for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 and 2022, and the three months ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides
additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.
