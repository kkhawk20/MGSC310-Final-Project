SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – (BUSINESS WIRE) – May 1, 2023 – SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SOFI), a
member-centric, one-stop shop for digital financial services that helps members borrow, save, spend, invest and
protect their money, reported financial results today for its first quarter ended March 31, 2023.
“We delivered another quarter of record financial results and generated our eighth consecutive quarter of record
adjusted net revenue, which was up 43% year-over-year. We also generated our third consecutive quarter of record
adjusted EBITDA at $76 million, representing a 48% incremental EBITDA margin and a 16% margin overall, as
well as a 54% incremental GAAP net income margin,” said Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi Technologies, Inc.
“Strength across all three of our business segments — Lending, Technology Platform and Financial Services —
drove these record results.”

Noto continued: “Our strong momentum in member, product and cross-buy adds, along with improving operating
efficiency, reflects the benefits of our broad product suite and unique Financial Services Productivity Loop (FSPL)
strategy. We added over 433,000 new members during the quarter, and ended with nearly 5.7 million total members,
up 46% year-over-year. We also added nearly 660,000 new products during the quarter, and ended with nearly 8.6
million total products, a 46% annual increase, while sales and marketing expenses as a percent of revenue declined
approximately 100 basis points sequentially and approximately 475 basis points year-over-year.”
Noto concluded: “Total deposits grew by a record $2.7 billion, up 37% during the quarter to $10 billion at quarter-
end, and 90% of SoFi Money deposits (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) are from
direct deposit members. For new direct deposit accounts opened in the first quarter, the median FICO score was
749. More than half of newly funded SoFi Money accounts are setting up direct deposit by day 30, and this has had
a significant impact on debit spending. With our launch of offering FDIC insurance of up to $2 million, 97% of our
deposits were insured at quarter end.
As a result of this growth in high quality deposits, we have benefited from a lower cost of funding for our loans.
Our deposit funding also increases our flexibility to capture additional net interest margin (NIM) and optimize
1
returns, a critical advantage in light of notable macro uncertainty. SoFi Bank, N.A. generated $73 million of GAAP
net income at a 20% margin.”
Consolidated Results
First quarter total GAAP net revenue increased 43% to $472.2 million from the prior-year period's $330.3 million.
First quarter adjusted net revenue of $460.2 million was up 43% from the same prior-year period's $321.7 million.
First quarter record adjusted EBITDA of $75.7 million increased 8% sequentially.
SoFi hit a number of key financial inflection points in the quarter, including adjusted EBITDA of $75.7 million
exceeding share-based compensation expense of $64.2 million, which was down from $71.0 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022, marking an important step toward of our goal of positive GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of
2023. Additionally, SoFi achieved positive variable profit in the Financial Services segment for the first time and is
on track for contribution profit by year end. SoFi recorded a GAAP net loss of $34.4 million for the first quarter of
2023, an improvement from the prior-year period's net loss of $110.4 million.
Member and Product Growth
SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the first quarter of 2023. New
member additions of over 433,000 brought total members to nearly 5.7 million by quarter-end, up nearly 1.8
million, or 46%, from the end of 2022's first quarter.
New product additions of nearly 660,000 in the first quarter brought total products to nearly 8.6 million at quarter-
end, up 46% from 5.9 million at the same prior year quarter-end.

Note: For additional information on our company metrics, including the definitions of "Members", "Total Products" and "Technology Platform Total
Accounts", see Table 5 in the “Financial Tables” herein.
(1) The Company includes SoFi accounts on the Galileo platform-as-a-service in its total Technology Platform accounts metric to better align with the
presentation of Technology Platform segment revenue.
(2) Technology Platform total accounts reflect the previously disclosed migration by one of our clients of the majority of its processing volumes to a pure
processor. These accounts remained open for administrative purposes through the end of the prior reporting period, and were included in our total
accounts in the prior period.
In the Financial Services segment, total products increased by 51% year-over-year, to 7.1 million from 4.7 million
in the first quarter of 2022. SoFi Money (inclusive of Checking and Savings and cash management accounts) grew
48% year-over-year to 2.4 million products, SoFi Invest grew 22% year-over-year to 2.2 million products, and SoFi
Relay grew 98% year-over-year to 2.2 million products.
Lending products increased 24% year-over-year to 1.4 million products, driven primarily by continued record
demand for personal loans.
Technology Platform enabled accounts increased by 15% year-over-year to 126.3 million.
Lending Segment Results
Lending segment GAAP and adjusted net revenues were $337.1 million and $325.1 million, respectively, for the
first quarter of 2023, up 33% and 33%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2022. Higher loan balances and
net interest margin expansion drove strong growth in net interest income.
Lending segment first quarter contribution profit of $209.9 million increased 58% from $132.7 million in the same
prior-year period. Contribution margin using Lending adjusted net revenue increased to 65% from 54% in the same
prior-year period. These advances reflect SoFi’s ability to capitalize on continued strong demand for its lending
products, while improving upon the member experience and realizing new efficiencies, at high credit underwriting
standards.

First quarter Lending segment total origination volume increased 7% year-over-year, as a result of continued strong
demand for personal loans.
Record personal loan originations of nearly $3 billion in the first quarter of 2023 were up $0.9 billion, or 46%, year-
over-year, and rose 20% sequentially. This strong performance was aided by years of investment in technology to
automate and accelerate the application-to-approval process for qualified borrowers and constant testing of risk
controls and underwriting models to maintain high credit quality. First quarter student loan volume of over $525
million was down more than 50% from the average pre-pandemic volume as the moratorium on federal student loan
payments continues to weigh on the business. First quarter home loan volumes of nearly $90 million were down
71% year-over-year, due to continued issues with fulfillment partners and macroeconomic headwinds from rising
rates. The Company is continuing to integrate Wyndham Capital Mortgage, which was acquired at the beginning of
the second quarter of 2023.

The Financial Services segment contribution loss was $24.2 million, reflecting a $25.3 million improvement over
the prior-year quarter's $49.5 million loss, as well as positive variable profit in the segment. This came as a result of
continued improvement in monetization for the segment, along with increasing operating leverage as we efficiently
scale this business.

Guidance and Outlook
Management expects to generate $470 to $480 million of adjusted net revenue in the second quarter of 2023, up
32% to 35% year-over-year, and $50 to $60 million of adjusted EBITDA.
For the full year 2023, management expects adjusted net revenue of $1.955 to $2.02 billion, up from its prior
guidance of $1.925 to $2.0 billion, and full-year adjusted EBITDA of $268 to $288 million, up from its prior
guidance of $260 to $280 million, representing a 30% incremental adjusted EBITDA margin. Management expects
to reach quarterly GAAP net income profitability by the fourth quarter of 2023, with GAAP net income incremental
margins for the full year of 20%.
Management will further address second quarter and full-year 2023 guidance on the quarterly earnings conference
call. Management has not reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable
GAAP measures of total net revenue, net income and gross margin. This is because the Company cannot predict
with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate outcome of certain GAAP components of
such reconciliations due to market-related assumptions that are not within our control as well as certain legal or
advisory costs, tax costs or other costs that may arise. For these reasons, management is unable to assess the
probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of the future
directly comparable GAAP measures.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This press release presents information about our adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP
financial measures provided as supplements to the results provided in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We use adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our
operating performance, formulate business plans, help better assess our overall liquidity position, and make strategic
decisions, including those relating to operating expenses and the allocation of internal resources. Accordingly, we
believe that adjusted net revenue and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in
understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. These non-GAAP
measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have limitations as analytical tools, and
should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the analysis of other GAAP financial measures,
such as total net revenue and net income (loss). Other companies may not use these non-GAAP measures or may
use similar measures that are defined in a different manner. Therefore, SoFi's non-GAAP measures may not be
directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures
to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are provided in Table 2 to the “Financial Tables” herein.
Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures are presented without reconciliations of such forward-looking non-
GAAP measures because the GAAP financial measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis and
reconciling information is not available without unreasonable effort due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and
quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including adjustments reflected in our
reconciliation of historic non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on historical experience,
could be material.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Reconciliation of Adjusted Net Revenue
Adjusted net revenue is defined as total net revenue, adjusted to exclude the fair value changes in servicing rights and residual
interests classified as debt due to valuation inputs and assumptions changes, which relate only to our Lending segment. For our
consolidated results and for the Lending segment, we reconcile adjusted net revenue to total net revenue, the most directly
comparable GAAP measure, as presented for the periods indicated below:

___________________
(1) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on servicing rights, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. These assumptions
are highly sensitive to market interest rate changes and are not indicative of our performance or results of operations. Moreover, these non-cash charges are
unrealized during the period and, therefore, have no impact on our cash flows from operations. As such, these positive and negative changes are adjusted out of
total net revenue to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the net revenue available to finance our operations and our overall
performance.
(2) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions on residual interests classified as debt, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates.
When third parties finance our consolidated securitization variable interest entities (“VIEs”) by purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of
the closing of the securitization and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash flows to the residual interest owner. These residual debt obligations are measured at
fair value on a recurring basis, but they have no impact on our initial financing proceeds, our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future
residual interest claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the general operations of our business. As such, these positive and
negative non-cash changes in fair value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of total net revenue to provide management and financial users with
better visibility into the net revenue available to finance our operations.

Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude, as applicable: (i) corporate borrowing-based interest expense
(our adjusted EBITDA measure is not adjusted for warehouse or securitization-based interest expense, nor deposit interest expense
and finance lease liability interest expense, as these are not direct operating expenses), (ii) income tax expense (benefit),
(iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) share-based expense (inclusive of equity-based payments to non-employees), (v) impairment
expense (inclusive of goodwill impairment and property, equipment and software abandonments), (vi) transaction-related expenses,
(vii) fair value changes in warrant liabilities, (viii) fair value changes in each of servicing rights and residual interests classified as
debt due to valuation assumptions, and (viv) other charges, as appropriate, that are not expected to recur and are not indicative of
our core operating performance. We reconcile adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for the
periods indicated below:

Adjusted EBITDA..................................................................................................................................... $ 75,689 $ 8,684
___________________
(1) Our adjusted EBITDA measure adjusts for corporate borrowing-based interest expense, as these expenses are a function of our capital structure. Corporate
borrowing-based interest expense included interest on our revolving credit facility and the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs on our
convertible notes. Revolving credit facility interest expense in the 2023 period increased due to higher interest rates relative to the prior year on identical
outstanding debt.
(2) Income taxes were primarily attributable to tax expense associated with the profitability of SoFi Bank in state jurisdictions where separate filings are required.
For the three-month 2023 period, this expense was more than offset by income tax benefits from foreign losses in jurisdictions with net deferred tax liabilities
related to Technisys.
(3) Depreciation and amortization expense for the 2023 period increased compared to 2022 primarily in connection with acquisitions and growth in our internally-
developed software balance during 2023.
(4) Restructuring charges in the 2023 period primarily included employee-related wages, benefits and severance associated with a small reduction in headcount in
our Technology Platform segment, which do not reflect expected future operating expenses and are not indicative of our core operating performance.
(5) Impairment expense in the 2023 period relates to a sublease arrangement, which is not indicative of our core operating performance.
(6) Transaction-related expenses in the 2022 period primarily included financial advisory and professional services costs associated with our acquisition of
Technisys.
(7) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including market servicing costs, conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. This non-cash
change is unrealized during the period and, therefore, has no impact on our cash flows from operations. As such, these positive and negative changes in fair
value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of net loss to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the earnings available
to finance our operations.
(8) Reflects changes in fair value inputs and assumptions, including conditional prepayment, default rates and discount rates. When third parties finance our
consolidated VIEs through purchasing residual interests, we receive proceeds at the time of the securitization close and, thereafter, pass along contractual cash
flows to the residual interest owner. These obligations are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, which has no impact on our initial financing proceeds,
our future obligations to the residual interest owner (because future residual interest claims are limited to contractual securitization collateral cash flows), or the
general operations of our business. As such, these positive and negative non-cash changes in fair value attributable to assumption changes are adjusted out of
net loss to provide management and financial users with better visibility into the earnings available to finance our operations.

___________________
(1) Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company included SoFi accounts on the Galileo platform-as-a-service in its total Technology Platform accounts
metric to better align with the presentation of Technology Platform segment revenue. Quarterly amounts for the earlier quarters in 2021 were determined to
be immaterial, and as such were not recast.
Members
We refer to our customers as “members”. We define a member as someone who has had a lending relationship with us through
origination and/or ongoing servicing, opened a financial services account, linked an external account to our platform, or signed up
for our credit score monitoring service. Our members have continuous access to our certified financial planners, our career advice
services, our member events, our content, educational material, news, tools and calculators, which are provided at no cost to the
member. We view members as an indication not only of the size and a measurement of growth of our business, but also as a
measure of the significant value of the data we have collected over time.
Once someone becomes a member, they are always considered a member unless they violate our terms of service. We adjust our
total number of members in the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service. This could occur for a
variety of reasons—including fraud or pursuant to certain legal processes—and, as our terms of service evolve together with our
business practices, product offerings and applicable regulations, additional grounds for removing members from our total member
count could occur. The determination that a member should be removed in accordance with our terms of service is subject to an
evaluation process, following the completion, and based on the results, of which, relevant members and their associated products
are removed from our total member count. However, depending on the length of the evaluation process, that removal may not take
place in the same period in which the member was added to our member count or the same period in which the circumstances
leading to their removal occurred. For this reason, our total member count in any one period may not yet reflect such adjustments.
Total Products
Total products refers to the aggregate number of lending and financial services products that our members have selected on our
platform since our inception through the reporting date, whether or not the members are still registered for such products. Total
products is a primary indicator of the size and reach of our Lending and Financial Services segments. Management relies on total
products metrics to understand the effectiveness of our member acquisition efforts and to gauge the propensity for members to use
more than one product.
In our Lending segment, total products refers to the number of personal loans, student loans and home loans that have been
originated through our platform through the reporting date, whether or not such loans have been paid off. If a member has
multiple loan products of the same loan product type, such as two personal loans, that is counted as a single product. However, if
a member has multiple loan products across loan product types, such as one personal loan and one home loan, that is counted as
two products.
In our Financial Services segment, total products refers to the number of SoFi Money accounts (presented inclusive of SoFi
Checking and Savings accounts held at SoFi Bank and cash management accounts), SoFi Invest accounts, SoFi Credit Card
accounts (including accounts with a zero dollar balance at the reporting date), referred loans (which are originated by a third-party
partner to which we provide pre-qualified borrower referrals), SoFi At Work accounts and SoFi Relay accounts (with either credit
score monitoring enabled or external linked accounts) that have been opened through our platform through the reporting date.
SoFi Checking and Savings accounts are considered one account within our total products metric. Our SoFi Invest service is
composed of three products: active investing accounts, robo-advisory accounts and digital assets accounts. Our members can
select any one or combination of the three types of SoFi Invest products. If a member has multiple SoFi Invest products of the
same account type, such as two active investing accounts, that is counted as a single product. However, if a member has multiple
SoFi Invest products across account types, such as one active investing account and one robo-advisory account, those separate
10
account types are considered separate products. In the event a member is removed in accordance with our terms of service, as
discussed under “Members” above, the member’s associated products are also removed.
Technology Platform Total Accounts
In our Technology Platform segment, total accounts refers to the number of open accounts at Galileo as of the reporting date.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we included intercompany accounts on the Galileo platform-as-a-service in our total
accounts metric to better align with the Technology Platform segment revenue, which includes intercompany revenue. We recast
the accounts in the fourth quarter of 2021, but did not recast the accounts for the earlier quarters in 2021, as the impact was
determined to be immaterial. Total accounts is a primary indicator of the accounts dependent upon Galileo’s technology platform
to use virtual card products, virtual wallets, make peer-to-peer and bank-to-bank transfers, receive early paychecks, separate
savings from spending balances, make debit transactions and rely upon real-time authorizations, all of which result in revenues for
the Technology Platform segment. We do not measure total accounts for the Technisys products and solutions, as the revenue
model is not dependent upon being a fully integrated, stand-ready service.
