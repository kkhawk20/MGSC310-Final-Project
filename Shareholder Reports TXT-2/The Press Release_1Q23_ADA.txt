From Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick:
“The value of responsible growth is evidenced again in our first quarter financial performance with 15% net income growth compared to Q1-22.
Results were strong despite a challenging economic environment with market and banking sector volatility. Revenue growth reflected strong
net interest income improvement coupled with one of our best quarters of sales and trading. Net interest income increased $2.9 billion, or 25%,
versus the year-ago quarter driven by higher rates along with loan growth, supported by our longstanding, deepening relationships with our
customers and clients.
"Asset quality remained strong with net charge-offs, while normalizing, still below pre-pandemic levels. We maintained strong liquidity, ending
the quarter with $904 billion of Global Liquidity Sources. Regulatory capital improved to $184 billion, and our CET1 ratio is nearly 100 basis
points above our current minimum requirements. Capital strength allowed us to return $4 billion back to shareholders, and we continued to
invest in our people and businesses.”

A Operating leverage is calculated as the year-over-year percentage change in revenue, net of interest expense, less the percentage change in noninterest expense.
B We present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (KPIs) that management uses when assessing consolidated and/or segment results. We believe
this information is useful because it provides management and investors with information about underlying operational performance and trends. KPIs are presented in
Balance Sheet, Liquidity and Capital Highlights and on the Segment pages for each segment.
C Pretax, pre-provision income (PTPI) at the consolidated level, as well as at the segment level, is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting the respective
entity’s pretax income to add back provision for credit losses. Management believes that PTPI (both at the consolidated and segment level) is a useful financial measure
as it enables an assessment of the Company’s ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle and provides an additional basis for comparing the
Company's results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods. For Reconciliations
to GAAP financial measures, see page 18 for Total company and below for segments.

D We also measure NII on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used in operating the business that management
believes provides investors with meaningful information on the interest margin for comparative purposes. We believe that this presentation allows for comparison of
amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. NII on an FTE basis was $14.6 billion, $14.8 billion and $11.7 billion for the
three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The FTE adjustment was $134 million, $123 million and $106 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022, respectively.
E Reserve Build (or Release) is calculated by subtracting net charge-offs for the period from the provision for credit losses recognized in that period. The period-end
allowance, or reserve, for credit losses reflects the beginning of the period allowance adjusted for net charge-offs recorded in that period plus the provision for credit
losses and other valuation accounts recognized in that period.
F Global Liquidity Sources (GLS) include cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities, inclusive of U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency
mortgage-backed securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities, and other investment-grade securities, and are readily available to
meet funding requirements as they arise. It does not include Federal Reserve Discount Window or Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing capacity. Transfers of liquidity
among legal entities may be subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions.
G Regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2023 are preliminary. The Corporation reports regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches.
Capital adequacy is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The
Corporation’s binding ratio was the Common equity tier 1 ratio under the Standardized approach for all periods presented.
H The below table includes Global Markets sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of
measures that exclude this item is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our
businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

(1) Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides
additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation
to outstanding shares of common stock. See Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 18.
(2) Ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. Charge-off ratios are annualized for the quarterly presentation.
(3) Balances do not include past due consumer credit card loans, consumer loans secured by real estate where repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration and individually insured long-term stand-by
agreements (fully-insured home loans), and in general, other consumer and commercial loans not secured by real estate, and nonperforming loans held-for-sale or accounted for under the fair value option.

(1) FTE basis is a non-GAAP financial measure. FTE basis is a performance measure used by management in operating the business that management believes provides investors with
meaningful information on the interest margin for comparative purposes. The Corporation believes that this presentation allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-
exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices. Net interest income includes FTE adjustments of $134 million, $123 million and $106 million for the first quarter of 2023 and
the fourth and first quarters of 2022, respectively.

Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures
(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
The Corporation evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common
shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common
shareholders’ equity). Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted
average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets (total assets less goodwill
and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities). Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures the Corporation’s net income as
a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets. Tangible book value
per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate the Corporation’s use of
equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals.
See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related financial measures defined by GAAP for the three months ended March 31, 2023,
December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022. The Corporation believes the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and
trends. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.
