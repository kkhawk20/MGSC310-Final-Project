Snap Inc. Announces Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results
Revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1,189 million
Daily Active Users increased 12% year-over-year to 406 million
Net loss was $368 million and Adjusted EBITDA was positive $40 million
SANTA MONICA, Calif. – October 24, 2023 – Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) today announced financial results for the quarter
ended September 30, 2023.
“Our revenue returned to positive growth in Q3, increasing 5% year-over-year and flowing through to positive adjusted
EBITDA as our reprioritized cost structure demonstrated the leverage in our business model,” said Evan Spiegel, CEO.
“We are focused on improving our advertising platform to drive higher return on investment for our advertising partners,
and we have evolved our go-to-market efforts to better serve our partners and drive customer success.”
Jerry Hunter, Chief Operating Officer, has notified Snap that he will retire. Mr. Hunter joined Snap seven years ago and
served an important role in building the company’s engineering and business structures. Mr. Hunter’s duties and
responsibilities will be transitioned by the end of the month and he will continue to support Snap through July 1, 2024 to
help ensure this transition is effective.
“I am deeply grateful to Jerry for the meaningful contributions he has made over his many years at Snap,” said Evan
Spiegel. “His work to improve our advertising platform, serve our community, and build a strong team has helped lay the
foundation for our future growth.”
Snap Inc. also announced today its board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million of
its Class A common stock. Repurchases of the Class A common stock may be made from time to time, either through open
market transactions (including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans) or through privately negotiated transactions in
accordance with applicable securities laws. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of
factors, including stock price, trading volume, market and economic conditions, and other general business considerations.
Repurchases under the program have been authorized for 12 months but the program may be modified, suspended, or
terminated at any time.
The goal of the program is to utilize the company’s strong balance sheet to opportunistically offset a portion of the dilution
related to the issuance of restricted stock units to employees as part of the overall compensation program designed to foster
an ownership culture.
Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2023, Snap
had $3.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

Q3 2023 Summary & Key Highlights
We grew and deepened our engagement with our community:
• DAUs were 406 million in Q3 2023, an increase of 43 million, or 12%, year-over-year.
• Total time spent watching Spotlight increased over 200% year-over-year.
• Since launching My AI, our AI-powered chatbot, over 200 million people have sent over 20 billion messages,
which we believe makes My AI among the most widely used AI chatbots available today.
• We launched our new Generative AI powered feature called Dreams, which enables Snapchatters to create
generative AI selfies.
• We are seeing more creators posting content to Snapchat, with nearly three times more public Stories posted in the
US compared to Q3 2022.
We are focused on accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth:
• We returned to positive revenue growth this quarter as we continue to execute against our strategy of accelerating
and diversifying our revenue growth.
• During Q3, we implemented over 17 major machine learning ranking and optimization improvements for App,
Web, and Dynamic Product Ad (DPA) optimization goals.
• We launched our Total Takeover solution, which includes First Commercial, First Lens, and First Story, and lets
advertisers reserve the first Commercial, Lens, or Snap Ad a Snapchatter sees.
• Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features, reached over 5
million subscribers in Q3 2023.
• We integrated with Shopify Audiences, which enables Shopify Plus merchants to extend their reach and find new
customers on Snapchat who have high intent to purchase their products.
• At our 2023 Beauty Summit in September, we announced new advertising tools for beauty brands such as beauty
AR Lenses and Bitmoji beauty drops.
We invested in our augmented reality platform:
• We launched the Real-Time Neural Rendering ML Model in Lens Studio, which enables developers to build AR
assets from 2D images captured on a phone.
• We launched Diffuse Indirect Lighting, a new Ray Tracing feature that brings a level of realism to how colors and
lights reflect and glow onto other objects.
• We introduced Lens Creator Rewards, a new opportunity for Snap AR creators, developers, and teams to be
rewarded for building top-performing Lenses on Snapchat.
• We partnered with MTV for their 2023 Video Music Awards to let the audience live cast their vote for the Best
New Artist category through an innovative Snapchat Lens via Camera Kit.
• For the 2023 NFL season, we partnered with the LA Rams and Disguise to deliver a sponsored Princess Cruises
AR experience powered by Camera Kit in SoFi Stadium.
• This summer, our AR technology enhanced music festivals across the world, including AR experiences for
Lollapalooza Paris, in partnership with Live Nation.
• For the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, we debuted a USWNT “Team Tracker” AR Lens that used advanced AR
technology, with 3D Bitmoji avatars, stats, news, fun facts, and highlights that updated in real time.

Q4 2023 Outlook
As we enter Q4, we anticipate continued growth in our global community and, as a result, our financial forecast for Q4 is
built on the assumption that DAU will reach 410 million to 412 million. We believe we are on the right path with our
direct-response advertising platform and are focused on executing against our roadmap to deliver further improvements.
That said, forward visibility of advertising demand remains limited due to several factors. First, revenue in Q4 is
historically backweighted, and the revenue mix in Q4 has historically included a relatively higher share from brand
advertising revenue, and brand advertising grew at a slower rate than direct-response advertising in Q3. In addition, we
observed pauses in spending from a large number of primarily brand-oriented advertising campaigns immediately
following the onset of the war in the Middle East, and this has been a headwind to revenue quarter-to-date. While some of
these campaigns have now resumed, and the impact on our revenue has partially diminished, we continue to observe new
pauses and the risk that these pauses could persist or increase in magnitude remains. Due to the unpredictable nature of
war, we believe it would be imprudent to provide formal guidance for Q4. Our internal forecast assumes a revenue range of
$1,320 million to $1,375 million, implying year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 2% to 6%. Within this range
of revenue, we estimate that adjusted EBITDA will be between $65 million and $105 million.

or expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not include all of the forward-looking statements made in this press
release.
You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking
statements contained in this press release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and
trends, including our financial outlook, macroeconomic uncertainty, and geo-political conflicts, that we believe may
continue to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These forward-looking statements
are subject to risks and uncertainties related to: our financial performance; our ability to attain and sustain profitability; our
ability to generate and sustain positive cash flow; our ability to attract and retain users, partners, and advertisers;
competition and new market entrants; managing our growth and future expenses; compliance with new laws, regulations,
and executive actions; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property; our ability to succeed in
existing and new market segments; our ability to attract and retain qualified team members and key personnel; our ability

and the potential adverse impact of climate change, natural disasters, health epidemics, macroeconomic conditions, and
war or other armed conflict, as well as risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in
our most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which is available on the
SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will be made available in our periodic report that will be filed with
the SEC for the period covered by this press release and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. In
addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events,
including future developments related to geo-political conflicts and macroeconomic conditions, except as required by law.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use
certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are
presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a
substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure
of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key
financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we
use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to
support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our
ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong
balance sheet and invest in future growth.
5
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding interest
income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-
based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other non-
cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps
identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in
Adjusted EBITDA.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss); excluding
amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based
compensation; certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related
income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate non-
GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify
underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance
the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to
key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP
measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe
that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over
multiple periods with other companies in our industry.
For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure,
please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”
