Q2 2023 Summary & Key Highlights
We grew and deepened our engagement with our community:
• DAUs were 397 million in Q2 2023, an increase of 50 million, or 14% year-over-year.
• DAUs increased sequentially and year-over-year in each of North America, Europe, and Rest of World.
• Total time spent watching Spotlight content more than tripled year-over-year, and Spotlight reached more than 400
million monthly active users on average in Q2, an increase of 51% year-over-year.
• Since launching My AI, our AI-powered chatbot, over 150 million people have sent over 10 billion messages,
which we believe makes My AI among the largest consumer chatbots available today.
• We introduced My AI Snaps for Snapchat+ subscribers, allowing subscribers to send Snaps to My AI and receive
an AI-generated Snap back that keeps the conversation going.
• We expanded our Stories revenue share program to more creators, helping more people build businesses on
Snapchat and enabling them to create content for our community.
• We onboarded new media partners and renewed agreements globally as we continue to grow our local content
offering, including ITV in the UK, ProSieben in Germany, Network 18 in India, and ESPN in the Netherlands.
We are focused on accelerating and diversifying our revenue growth:
• We are seeing significant adoption of our new 7/0 Pixel Purchase optimization model, which contributed to a
more than 40% quarter-over-quarter increase in 7/0 Pixel Purchase conversions.
• The combination of improvements to our machine learning (ML) infrastructure and systems for ad ranking and
optimization have led to more relevant ads and a more than 30% increase in purchase related conversions quarter-
over-quarter.
• We introduced our Event Quality Score system to advertisers to measure the quality and integrity of their data,
which we expect will lead to improvement in attribution and advertiser performance.
• We made fundamental improvements to our privacy-preserving identity graph and modeled conversions, which
will strengthen the connection between identity, attribution, and optimization.
• Snapchat+, our subscription service that offers exclusive, experimental, and pre-release features, reached over 4
million paying subscribers in Q2, one year after launch.
• We introduced new Snapchat+ features like app icons, custom themes, and Bitmoji pets & cars on the Snap Map.
• We launched ads in Spotlight for all advertisers globally, allowing brands to reach the Snapchat audience on our
newest surface.
• We are testing My AI monetization with sponsored links that connect our community with partners relevant to
their conversation in that moment, while helping brands reach Snapchatters who have indicated potential interest
in their offerings.
• We launched First Story, which enables advertisers to reserve the first video ad between Friend Stories, making
First Story the latest offering in our takeover lineup, following First Commercial and First Lens.
• We made it easier for brands and creators to work together with the US launch of the Snap Star Collab Studio for
brands to source, partner, and drive results with Snap Stars.

We invested in our augmented reality platform:
• We launched Lens Performance Toolkit in Lens Studio, which offers developers a dashboard view of
performance-related metrics for Lenses that are in development.
• We introduced ML Retouch, our newest retouch feature powered by ML in Lens Studio, which enables Creators to
easily switch on the feature for realistic skin retouch and accurate texture.
• We announced a partnership with Roboflow that enables Lens Studio developers to utilize Roboflow’s ML tools to
easily train and bring models directly into SnapML.
• We launched our first Snap AR Learn Hub, which includes AR courses to teach different AR development
concepts in Lens Studio, along with a library of live streams and product tutorials.
• We partnered with OPI, a beauty brand, on a Lens featuring first-of-its-kind Snap AR tech called Nails
Segmentation, which makes the digital nail try-on experience more realistic than ever before.
• Snapchat and Disney came together in a groundbreaking collaboration at the 2023 Cannes Lions International
Festival of Creativity that illustrated how Augmented Reality can enhance storytelling, and brought to life
legendary characters and tales in celebration of Disney100.
• Snapchat’s AR Studio in Paris teamed up with Daft Punk to celebrate the release of Random Access Memories
10th Anniversary Edition by bringing to life “Daft Punk: Memories Unlocked,” a series of new augmented reality
experiences for fans around the world.
• Camera Kit Live was launched to additional venues and music tours, including Duran Duran’s successful arena
tour, the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, and the NBA draft.
• We introduced new advanced Snapchat Lenses built by teams from the Snap AR community including Brick.it
which used SnapML to integrate Brick.it’s custom-built ML model, letting Snapchatters scan a pile of toy bricks,
identify pieces, and suggest ideas for what can be built.
• In honor of Juneteenth, Snap Lens Network developer, Andre Elijah Immersive, and Santa Monica History
Museum collaborated to show the city’s history in AR – bringing stories out of the museum and into the
neighborhood.

Q3 Outlook
As we enter Q3, we anticipate continued robust growth in our global community and, as a result, our financial guidance for
Q3 is built on the assumption that DAU will reach 405 million to 406 million in Q3. From a revenue perspective, our
business remains in a period of rapid transition as we work to improve our advertising platform, while forward visibility of
advertising demand remains limited. Our guidance range for Q3 revenue reflects our best estimate of these factors, with
total revenue estimated to be between $1,070 to $1,130 million implying negative 5% to flat year-over-year growth. At this
level of revenue, we estimate that Adjusted EBITDA will be between negative $50 million and negative $100 million
reflecting estimated infrastructure costs per DAU of $0.79 to $0.84 in Q3, as we continue to invest in ML, AI, and other
infrastructure to improve the performance of our ad platform, drive deeper content engagement, and bring innovative
product experiences to our community. This forecast also assumes modest sequential headcount growth as we continue to
carefully calibrate our operating investments to focus on the inputs most essential to the acceleration of topline growth.

or expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not include all of the forward-looking statements made in this press
release.
You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking
statements contained in this press release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and
trends, including our financial outlook, macroeconomic uncertainty, and geo-political conflicts, that we believe may
continue to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These forward-looking statements
are subject to risks and uncertainties related to: our financial performance; our ability to attain and sustain profitability; our
ability to generate and sustain positive cash flow; our ability to attract and retain users, partners, and advertisers;
competition and new market entrants; managing our growth and future expenses; compliance with new laws, regulations,
and executive actions; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual property; our ability to succeed in
existing and new market segments; our ability to attract and retain qualified team members and key personnel; our ability

and the potential adverse impact of climate change, natural disasters, health epidemics, macroeconomic conditions, and
war or other armed conflict, as well as risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in
our most recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which is available on the
SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will be made available in our periodic report that will be filed with
the SEC for the period covered by this press release and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. In
addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events,
including future developments related to geo-political conflicts and macroeconomic conditions, except as required by law.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use
certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are
presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a
substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure
of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key
financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we
use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to
support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our
ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong
balance sheet and invest in future growth.
5
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding interest
income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-
based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other non-
cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps
identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in
Adjusted EBITDA.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss); excluding
amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based
compensation; certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related
income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate non-
GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify
underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance
the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to
key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP
measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe
that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over
multiple periods with other companies in our industry.
For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure,
please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

(1) Total revenue for geographic reporting is apportioned to each region based on our determination of the geographic location in
which advertising impressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity. This allocation is consistent
with how we determine ARPU.
(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by GAAP revenue.
