Sea Limited Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Results
Singapore, March 7, 2023 – Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) (“Sea” or the “Company”) today
announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2022.
“We are starting 2023 on a much stronger footing,” said Forrest Li, Sea’s Chairman and Group
Chief Executive Officer. “Our decisive pivot to focus on efficiency and profitability since late last
year is already driving meaningful bottom line improvements. We delivered positive total net
income in the fourth quarter, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our underlying business
model and the execution capabilities of our teams. As we continue this transition and maintain our
focus on sustainable growth, our approach is to do less but do it better as we serve our users across
our digital ecosystem.”
“Given the macro uncertainty and our recent strong pivot, we are closely monitoring the market
environment and we will continue to adjust our pace and fine-tune our operations accordingly.
While there may be near-term fluctuations in our performance, we remain highly confident in the
long-term growth potential of our markets and fully focused on capturing this opportunity.”
Fourth Quarter 2022 Highlights
▪ Group
o Total GAAP revenue was US$3.5 billion, up 7.1% year-on-year.
o Total gross profit was US$1.7 billion, up 29.5% year-on-year.
o Total net income turned positive to US$422.8 million, as compared to US$(616.3)
million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Total net income was:
▪ negatively impacted by US$177.7 million impairment of goodwill related to
certain historical investments for the digital entertainment business, and
▪ positively impacted by US$199.7 million net gain on debt extinguishment
as discussed below, and approximately US$130 million in reversal of
previous accruals for certain expenses (“accruals reversal”). As we made the
management decision to strongly pivot to a clear focus on cost efficiency,
there were accruals reversed during the quarter resulting from changes in
previous estimations of certain expenses.
o Total adjusted EBITDA1 turned positive to US$495.7 million, as compared to
US$(492.1) million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Total adjusted EBITDA was
also positively impacted by approximately US$130 million of accruals reversal as
mentioned above.
o As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were
US$6.9 billion, representing a net change of US$(401.6) million from September
30, 2022. Excluding cash consideration used to repurchase our outstanding
convertible bonds with a gain as discussed below, cash, cash equivalents and short-
term investments would have increased by US$209.8 million from September 30,
2022.
1
o In the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased US$817.2 million aggregate
principal amount of the 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 (the “2026 CB”),
for a cash consideration of US$611.3 million. This resulted in a US$199.7 million
gain on debt extinguishment, inclusive of an accelerated deferred issuance cost of
US$6.2 million, and US$7.7 million savings in future interest payments. As of the
date hereof, approximately US$2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2026
CB remained outstanding.
▪ E-commerce
o GAAP revenue was US$2.1 billion, up 31.8% year-on-year. Based on constant
currency assumptions2, GAAP revenue was up 42.3% year-on-year.
o GAAP revenue included US$1.8 billion of GAAP marketplace revenue, which
consists of core marketplace revenue and value-added services revenue and
increased by 43.5% year-on-year.
• Core marketplace revenue, mainly consisting of transaction-based fees and
advertising revenues, was up 53.9% year-on-year to US$1.1 billion.
• Value-added services revenue, mainly consisting of revenues related to
logistics services, was up 29.2% year-on-year to US$0.7 billion.
o Adjusted EBITDA1 turned positive to US$196.1 million, as compared to
US$(877.7) million for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was
positively impacted by approximately US$80 million of accruals reversal as
described earlier.
▪ Asia markets recorded adjusted EBITDA of US$320.0 million, as
compared to US$(525.8) million for the fourth quarter of 2021.
▪ Other markets recorded adjusted EBITDA of US$(123.9) million, as
compared to US$(352.0) million for the fourth quarter of 2021. In Brazil,
unit economics continued to improve significantly, with contribution
margin loss per order improving 53.9% quarter-on-quarter to reach
US$0.47.
o Gross orders were 1.7 billion, as compared to 2.0 billion for the fourth quarter of
2021. Gross merchandise value (“GMV”) was US$18.0 billion, as compared to
US$18.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. Based on constant currency
assumptions2, GMV was up 7.7% year-on-year. Beginning 2023, we will transition
from quarterly to annual disclosure of such operating metrics.
▪ Digital Entertainment
o GAAP revenue was US$948.9 million, as compared to US$892.9 million for the
previous quarter.
o Bookings3 were US$543.6 million, as compared to US$664.7 million for the
previous quarter.

the previous quarter.

as compared to 43.6% for the previous quarter.
o Quarterly active users were 485.5 million, as compared to 568.2 million for the
previous quarter.
o Quarterly paying users were 43.6 million, representing a paying user ratio of 9.0%,
as compared to 9.1% for the previous quarter.

2
▪ Digital Financial Services
o GAAP revenue was US$380.2 million, up 92.5% year-on-year.
o Adjusted EBITDA1 turned positive to US$75.6 million, as compared to US$(149.8)
million for the fourth quarter of 2021.
o As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, total loans receivable was US$2.1
billion, net of allowance for credit losses of US$238.8 million. Non-performing
loans past due by more than 90 days as a percentage of our total gross loans
receivable declined from less than 4% in the third quarter of 2022 to less than 2%.
This was mainly due to the shortening of loan write-off period in a certain market
from 180 days to 120 days in the fourth quarter based on our assessment of
historical credit losses. Without this change in write-off period, the ratio would be
about 5%.

Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Three Months Ended December
31, 2021
Revenue
Our total GAAP revenue increased by 7.1% to US$3.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 from
US$3.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.
• Digital Entertainment: GAAP revenue was US$948.9 million compared to US$1.4 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily attributable to the ongoing moderation in user
engagement and monetization.
• E-commerce and other services: GAAP revenue increased by 50.5% to US$2.2 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2022 from US$1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven
by the improved monetization in our e-commerce business and the growth of our credit
business.
• Sales of goods: GAAP revenue was US$271.6 million, as compared to US$324.4 million in
the fourth quarter of 2021.
Cost of Revenue
Our total cost of revenue decreased by 8.2% to US$1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022 from
US$1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.
• Digital Entertainment: Cost of revenue decreased by 35.3% to US$242.5 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022 from US$374.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was largely in
line with the decrease in digital entertainment revenue.
• E-commerce and other services: Cost of revenue for our e-commerce and other services segment
combined was US$1.3 billion, as compared to US$1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Improvement in gross profit margins was mainly due to our better cost efficiencies.
• Cost of goods sold: Cost of goods sold decreased by 23.8% to US$229.6 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022 from US$301.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.

related logistics services providers.

Sales and Marketing Expenses
Our total sales and marketing expenses decreased by 61.2% to US$473.6 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022 from US$1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The table below sets forth the
breakdown of the sales and marketing expenses of our major reporting segments. Amounts are
expressed in thousands of US dollars (“$”).
For the Three Months
ended December 31,
2021 2022 YOY%
Sales and Marketing Expenses $ $
Digital Entertainment 109,625 43,262 (60.5)%
E-commerce 840,727 379,369 (54.9)%
Digital Financial Services 228,729 29,918 (86.9)%
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses across all major reporting segments were mainly
attributable to our efforts to continue optimizing operating costs and achieving higher cost
efficiencies.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses increased by 24.0% to US$352.3 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022 from US$284.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The increase was primarily
driven by impairment costs incurred due to the exits from non-core markets and certain
divestments.
Provision for Credit Losses
Our provision for credit losses increased by 407.1% to US$175.1 million in the fourth quarter of
2022 from US$34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily driven by the growth in our
loan book.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses decreased by 14.8% to US$244.2 million in the fourth
quarter of 2022 from US$286.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the impact
of the accruals reversal as described earlier.
Impairment of Goodwill
We recorded an impairment of goodwill of US$177.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2022,
compared to nil in the fourth quarter of 2021. The goodwill impairment was primarily due to our
strategic decisions to dispose of or shut down certain historical investments for the digital
entertainment business.
8
Non-operating Income or Losses, Net
Non-operating income or losses consist of interest income, interest expense, investment gain (loss),
and foreign exchange gain (loss), and gain (loss) from debt extinguishment. We recorded a net
non-operating income of US$35.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, as compared to a net non-
operating loss of US$71.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our non-operating income in the
fourth quarter of 2022 was mainly due to a US$199.7 million net gain from debt extinguishment,
partially offset by investment losses recognized amid lower valuations in the broader market.
Income Tax Credit or Expenses
We had a net income tax credit of US$43.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, as compared to
net income tax expense of US$105.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. The income tax credit
was primarily due to recognition of deferred tax assets from carried forward losses for our e-
commerce business, partially offset by income tax incurred by our digital entertainment business.
Net Income or Loss
As a result of the foregoing, we had net income of US$422.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2022,
as compared to net loss of US$616.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Basic and Diluted Earnings or Loss Per Share Attributable to Sea Limited’s Ordinary
Shareholders

• Digital Entertainment: GAAP revenue was US$3.9 billion for the full year ended December

full year ended December 31, 2022 from US$4.6 billion for the full year ended December

relatively stable year-on-year.

ended December 31, 2022 from US$1.2 billion for the full year ended December 31, 2021,

combined increased by 35.8% to US$5.2 billion for the full year ended December 31, 2022
from US$3.8 billion for the full year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by higher
costs of logistics from order growth and other costs related to the growth of e-commerce
marketplace. Improvement in gross profit margins was mainly due to the growth of core
marketplace revenue with higher gross profit margin.
• Cost of goods sold: Cost of goods sold was US$1.0 billion for the full year ended December
31, 2022.
Other Operating Income
Our other operating income was US$279.2 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022

Sales and Marketing Expenses $ $
Digital Entertainment 357,106 268,061 (24.9)%
E-commerce 2,630,401 2,328,636 (11.5)%
Digital Financial Services 742,702 508,089 (31.6)%
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses across all major reporting segments was mainly
attributable to our efforts to continue optimizing operating costs and achieving higher cost
efficiencies.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses increased by 45.5% to US$1.4 billion for the full year
ended December 31, 2022 from US$987.9 million for the full year ended December 31, 2021. The
increase was primarily due to the higher staff cost from higher average staff headcount over the
year, as well as higher office facilities and related expenses to support the headcount growth.
Provision for Credit Losses
Our provision for credit losses increased by 337.5% to US$513.7 million for the full year ended
December 31, 2022 from US$117.4 million for the full year ended December 31, 2021, primarily
driven by the growth in our loan book.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses increased by 65.5% to US$1.4 billion for the full year
ended December 31, 2022 from US$831.7 million for the full year ended December 31, 2021,
primarily due to the increase in research and development staff cost from higher average staff
headcount over the year.
Impairment of Goodwill
We recorded an impairment of goodwill of US$354.9 million for the full year ended December 31,
2022, as compared to nil for the full year ended December 31, 2021. The goodwill impairment was
primarily due to the change in carrying amount of goodwill associated with our prior acquisitions,
mainly driven by the lower valuations amid the market uncertainties, and our strategic decision to
dispose of or shut down certain historical investments for the digital entertainment business.
11
Non-operating Income or Losses, Net
Non-operating income or losses mainly consist of interest income, interest expense, investment
gain (loss), and foreign exchange gain (loss), and gain (loss) on debt extinguishment. We recorded
a net non-operating loss of US$13.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2022, as
compared to a net non-operating loss of US$132.1 million for the full year ended December 31,
2021.
Income Tax Expense
We had a net income tax expense of US$168.4 million and US$332.9 million for the full year ended
December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The lower income tax expense was primarily due to
recognition of deferred tax assets from carried forward losses for our e-commerce business, as
well as lower income tax expense incurred by our digital entertainment business.
Net Loss
As a result of the foregoing, we had net loss of US$1.7 billion and US$2.0 billion for the full year
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help evaluate
our operating performance:
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our digital entertainment segment represents operating income (loss)
before share-based compensation and impairment of goodwill plus (a) depreciation and
amortization expenses, and (b) the net effect of changes in deferred revenue and its related
cost for our digital entertainment segment. We believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA
helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of
the past performance and future prospects.
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our e-commerce segment, digital financial services segment and
other services segment represents operating income (loss) before share-based compensation
plus depreciation and amortization expenses. We believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA
helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of
the past performance and future prospects.
• “Total adjusted EBITDA” represents the sum of adjusted EBITDA of all our segments
combined, plus unallocated expenses. We believe that the total adjusted EBITDA helps to
identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past
performance and future prospects.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. None of the above
financial measures should be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to revenue, net
loss/income, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly
titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to Sea’s data. We
compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest
U.S. GAAP financial measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating our
performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on
any single financial measure.

financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures, and the related
