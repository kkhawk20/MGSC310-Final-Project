amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,

facts contained in this press release, including statements regarding guidance, our future results of operations or financial
condition, our future stock repurchase programs or stock dividends, business strategy and plans, user growth and
engagement, product initiatives, objectives of management for future operations, and advertiser and partner offerings, are
forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such

“potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” or “would” or the negative of these words or other similar terms
or expressions. We caution you that the foregoing may not include all of the forward-looking statements made in this press
release.
You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking
statements contained in this press release primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and
trends, including our financial outlook, macroeconomic uncertainty, geo-political conflicts, and the persisting effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, that we believe may continue to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
prospects. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties related to: our financial performance; our
ability to attain and sustain profitability; our ability to generate and sustain positive cash flow; our ability to attract and
retain users, partners, and advertisers; competition and new market entrants; managing our growth and future expenses;
compliance with new laws, regulations, and executive actions; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our intellectual
property; our ability to succeed in existing and new market segments; our ability to attract and retain qualified team
members and key personnel; our ability to repay outstanding debt; future acquisitions, divestitures, or investments; and the
potential adverse impact of climate change, natural disasters, health epidemics, macroeconomic conditions, and war or
other armed conflict, as well as risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in our most
recent periodic report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, which is available on the SEC’s
website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will be made available in Snap Inc.’s periodic report that will be filed with
the SEC for the period covered by this press release and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC. In
addition, any forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or
circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events,
including future developments related to geo-political conflicts, the persisting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
macroeconomic conditions, except as required by law.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use
certain non-GAAP financial measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance.
These non-GAAP financial measures, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are
presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a
substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Free Cash Flow, which is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure
of the cash that is available, after capital expenditures, for operational expenses and investment in our business and is a key
financial indicator used by management. Additionally, we believe that Free Cash Flow is an important measure since we
use third-party infrastructure partners to host our services and therefore we do not incur significant capital expenditures to
support revenue generating activities. Free Cash Flow is useful to investors as a liquidity measure because it measures our
ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong
balance sheet and invest in future growth.
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss); excluding interest
income; interest expense; other income (expense), net; income tax benefit (expense); depreciation and amortization; stock-
based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based compensation; and certain other non-
cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps
identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in
Adjusted EBITDA.
5
We use the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP net income (loss), which is defined as net income (loss); excluding
amortization of intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; payroll and other tax expense related to stock-based
compensation; certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time; and related
income tax adjustments. Non-GAAP net income (loss) and weighted average diluted shares are then used to calculate non-
GAAP diluted net income (loss) per share. Similar to Adjusted EBITDA, we believe these measures help identify
underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses we exclude in the measure.
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about our financial performance, enhance
the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to
key metrics used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We are presenting these non-GAAP
measures to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe
that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over
multiple periods with other companies in our industry.
For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure,
please see “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

(1) Total revenue for geographic reporting is apportioned to each region based on our determination of the geographic location in
which advertising impressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity. This allocation is consistent
with how we determine ARPU.
(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by GAAP revenue.
