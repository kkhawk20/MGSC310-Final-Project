Holland America Line Sets New Black Friday Records for Bookings in the U.S.
November 29, 2023
Record weekends for two consecutive years show continued strength for cruising
SEATTLE, Nov. 29, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- For the second year in a row, Holland America Line's Black Friday booking volumes broke a record high for
the shopping holiday in the United States, with volume for the day more than 20% higher than last year's record high and 23% higher for the period
from Black Friday through Cyber Monday.
The trend was especially noticeable with guests planning summer vacations in 2024, with bookings for Alaska, Europe and Canada/New England all
surpassing volumes from last year's Black Friday sales.
"While some see Black Friday as a sign that winter is coming, our guests were dreaming about exploring summer destinations like Alaska, Iceland and
Greece," said Gus Antorcha, president, Holland America Line. "Breaking Black Friday records two years in a row tells us that not only are guests
excited to plan ahead for travel, but that they value Holland America Line's award-winning service and carefully crafted itineraries that visit more than
100 countries."
Holland America Line's summer cruises include six ships in Alaska, offering the most Glacier Bay permits in the cruise industry, the most glacier
viewing experiences and the most opportunities to see the animals of Alaska with nearly 180 shore excursions that take guests on a wildlife encounter.
The summer season also highlights cruising in the Canada/New England region, with several itineraries extending up to Iceland and Greenland.
The record Black Friday weekend comes just weeks after Holland America Line announced a new global fresh fish program. The pioneering initiative
engages a global network of 60 ports to source and serve 80 types of fresh fish on board in all restaurants, going from port to plate in less than 48
hours. The program also engages world-renowned Chef Masaharu Morimoto to serve as Holland America Line's "Fresh Fish Ambassador." Chef
Morimoto brings his signature style to curated dishes served in the ships' Dining Rooms, as well as Morimoto By Sea, a new stand-alone restaurant
aboard Nieuw Amsterdam launching on the Dec. 16, 2023, cruise and a Morimoto By Sea pop-up restaurant on the remainder of the fleet by spring of
2024.
Holland America Line's Black Friday incentives run through December 1 and include prepaid crew appreciation, up to 30% off cruise fares and $25
deposit on eligible cruises.
