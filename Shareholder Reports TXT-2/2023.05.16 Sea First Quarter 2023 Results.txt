Sea Limited Reports First Quarter 2023 Results
Singapore, May 16, 2023 – Sea Limited (NYSE: SE) (“Sea” or the “Company”) today announced
its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023.
“The first quarter of 2023 was another strong quarter for us,” said Forrest Li, Sea’s Chairman and
Group Chief Executive Officer. “The results for the quarter are a testament to our team’s
commitment and creativity. We have innovated to do more with fewer resources, while never
losing sight of our commitment to our users, and never letting our service standards fall. Across
our business, we have been focused on maximizing operational efficiency and improving user
experiences. And we continued to make meaningful progress on both fronts.”
“We are also pleased with the progress we have made so far to strengthen the fundamentals of our
business. As we continue to fine-tune our operations and navigate near-term macro uncertainties,
we remain highly confident in the long-term opportunities in our markets and our ability to capture
those profitably.”

Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2022
Revenue
Our total GAAP revenue increased by 4.9% to US$3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023 from
US$2.9 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
• Digital Entertainment: GAAP revenue was US$539.7 million compared to US$1.1 billion in
the first quarter of 2022, primarily attributable to the ongoing moderation in user
engagement and monetization.
• E-commerce and other services: GAAP revenue increased by 50.7% to US$2.3 billion in the first
quarter of 2023 from US$1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by the
improved monetization in our e-commerce business and the growth of our credit business.
• Sales of goods: GAAP revenue was US$241.8 million, as compared to US$264.8 million in
the first quarter of 2022.
Cost of Revenue
Our total cost of revenue decreased by 6.1% to US$1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023 from
US$1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
• Digital Entertainment: Cost of revenue decreased by 43.9% to US$173.4 million in the first
quarter of 2023 from US$309.2 million in the first quarter of 2022, which was largely in
line with the decrease in digital entertainment revenue.
• E-commerce and other services: Cost of revenue for our e-commerce and other services segment
combined was US$1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2023, relatively flat year-on-year.
Improvement in gross profit margins was driven by increased monetization and greater
operating cost efficiencies in our e-commerce business.
• Cost of goods sold: Cost of goods sold decreased by 14.0% to US$209.7 million in the first
quarter of 2023 from US$243.9 million in the first quarter of 2022.
Other Operating Income
Our other operating income was US$57.9 million and US$73.7 million in the first quarter of 2023
and 2022, respectively. Other operating income mainly consists of rebates from e-commerce
related logistics services providers.
5
Sales and Marketing Expenses
Our total sales and marketing expenses decreased by 60.2% to US$400.1 million in the first quarter
of 2023 from US$1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2022. The table below sets forth breakdown of
the sales and marketing expenses of our major reporting segments. Amounts are expressed in
thousands of US dollars (“$”).
For the Three Months
ended March 31,
2022 2023 YOY%
Sales and Marketing Expenses $ $
Digital Entertainment 77,178 23,447 (69.6)%
E-commerce 699,471 338,189 (51.7)%
Digital Financial Services 184,881 20,159 (89.1)%
The decrease in sales and marketing expenses across all major reporting segments was mainly
attributable to our efforts to continue optimizing operating costs and achieving higher cost
efficiencies.
General and Administrative Expenses
Our general and administrative expenses were US$333.4 million, as compared to US$315.7 million
in the first quarter of 2022, relatively flat year-on-year as we are focusing on cost efficiencies.
Provision for Credit Losses
Our provision for credit losses increased by 120.5% to US$177.4 million in the first quarter of
2023 from US$80.5 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by expansion to a broader
user base and the growth of our loan book.
Research and Development Expenses
Our research and development expenses decreased by 5.8% to US$320.5 million in the first quarter
of 2023 from US$340.4 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily attributable to lower staff
cost from lower headcount.
Impairment of Goodwill
We recorded an impairment of goodwill of US$117.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, compared
to nil in the first quarter of 2022. The goodwill impairment was primarily due to the change in
carrying amount of goodwill associated with our prior acquisition.
Non-operating Income or Losses, Net
Non-operating income or losses mainly consist of interest income, interest expense, investment
gain (loss) and foreign exchange gain (loss). We recorded a net non-operating income of US$22.5
million in the first quarter of 2023, as compared to a net non-operating loss of US$6.1 million in
the first quarter of 2022. The higher net non-operating income was mainly due to higher interest
income from higher yields.
6
Income Tax Expense
We had a net income tax expense of US$61.9 million and US$81.8 million in the first quarter of
2023 and 2022, respectively. The income tax expense in the first quarter of 2023 was primarily due
to corporate income tax and withholding tax expenses incurred by our digital entertainment and
e-commerce businesses.
Net Income or Loss
As a result of the foregoing, we had net income of US$87.3 million in the first quarter of 2023, as
compared to net loss of US$580.1 million in the first quarter of 2022.
Basic and Diluted Earnings or Loss Per Share Attributable to Sea Limited’s Ordinary
Shareholders
Basic earnings per share attributable to Sea Limited’s ordinary shareholders was US$0.16 in the
first quarter of 2023, as compared to basic loss per share attributable to Sea Limited’s ordinary
shareholders of US$1.04 in the first quarter of 2022.
Diluted earnings per share attributable to Sea Limited’s ordinary shareholders was US$0.15 in the
first quarter of 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help evaluate
our operating performance:
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our digital entertainment segment represents operating income (loss)
before share-based compensation plus (a) depreciation and amortization expenses, and (b) the
net effect of changes in deferred revenue and its related cost for our digital entertainment
segment. We believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA helps to identify underlying trends
in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past performance and future
prospects.
• “Adjusted EBITDA” for our e-commerce segment, digital financial services segment and
other services segment represents operating income (loss) before share-based compensation
plus depreciation and amortization expenses. We believe that the segment adjusted EBITDA
helps to identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of
the past performance and future prospects.
• “Total adjusted EBITDA” represents the sum of adjusted EBITDA of all our segments
combined, plus unallocated expenses. We believe that the total adjusted EBITDA helps to
identify underlying trends in our operating results, enhancing their understanding of the past
performance and future prospects.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. None of the above
financial measures should be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to revenue, net
loss/income, or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly
titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to Sea’s data. We
compensate for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest
U.S. GAAP financial measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating our
performance. We encourage you to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on
any single financial measure.
