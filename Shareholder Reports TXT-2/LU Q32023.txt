[1]
For the third quarter of 2023, the Company's retail credit enablement business take rate
based on loan balance was 7.8%, unchanged from the third quarter of 2022.
[2]
C-M3 flow rate for the total loans the Company had enabled was 1.1% in the third
quarter of 2023, compared to 1.0% the second quarter of 2023. Flow rates for the general
unsecured loans and secured loans the Company had enabled were 1.2% and 0.7%
respectively in the third quarter of 2023, as compared to 1.2% and 0.5% respectively in the
second quarter of 2023.
[3]
Days past due ("DPD") 30+ delinquency rate for the total loans the Company had
enabled was 6.0% as of September 30, 2023, as compared to 5.9% as of June 30, 2023.
DPD 30+ delinquency rate for general unsecured loans was 6.9% as of September 30,

[5]
As of September 30, 2023, Non-performing loan (NPL) ratio for consumer finance loans
was 1.9% as compared to 2.2% as of June 30, 2023.
[1]
The take rate of retail credit enablement business is calculated by dividing the aggregated
amount of loan enablement service fees, post-origination service fees, net interest income,
guarantee income and the penalty fees and account management fees by the average
outstanding balance of loans enabled for each period.
[2]
Flow rate estimates the percentage of current loans that will become non-performing at the
end of three months, and is defined as the product of (i) the loan balance that is overdue from
1 to 29 days as a percentage of the total current loan balance of the previous month, (ii) the
loan balance that is overdue from 30 to 59 days as a percentage of the loan balance that was
overdue from 1 to 29 days in the previous month, and (iii) the loan balance that is overdue
from 60 to 89 days as a percentage of the loan balance that was overdue from 30 days to 59
days in the previous month. Loans from legacy products and consumer finance subsidiary are
excluded from the flow rate calculation.
[3]
DPD 30+ delinquency rate refers to the outstanding balance of loans for which any payment
is 30 to 179 calendar days past due divided by the outstanding balance of loans. Loans from
legacy products and consumer finance subsidiary are excluded from the calculation.
[4]
DPD 90+ delinquency rate refers to the outstanding balance of loans for which any payment
is 90 to 179 calendar days past due divided by the outstanding balance of loans. Loans from
legacy products and consumer finance subsidiary are excluded from the calculation.
[5]
Non-performing loan ratio for consumer finance loans is calculated by using the
outstanding balance of consumer finance loans for which any payment is 61 or more calendar
days past due and not written off, and certain restructured loans, divided by the outstanding
balance of consumer finance loans.
Mr. YongSuk Cho, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Lufax, commented, "While recent
data has indicated that China's economy is on the road to recovery, high-quality demand for
loans from SBOs remained weak in the third quarter. Given this environment, we took steps to
further de-risk and diversify our business during the quarter, emphasizing prudent decision-
making and long-term, sustainable growth. We continued to prioritize asset quality over
quantity, with early indicators suggesting that the asset quality of new loans enabled in 2023 is
in line with our expectations, though not yet recovered to pre-COVID levels. We have also
secured sufficient credit lines from our funding partners to support our 100% guarantee model
for the remainder of 2023 and throughout 2024, laying the foundation for an improved take
rate in the long term. Meanwhile, our consumer finance business continued to record healthy
growth during the third quarter, with new loan sales volume increasing by 15.3% sequentially
and 48.5% year over year. As part of our diversification efforts, we plan to acquire 100% of the
equity interest of Ping An OneConnect Bank, pending the approval of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority and OneConnect's shareholders. PAOB is a fully licensed bank with a service scope
similar to traditional banks. As of June 30, 2023, a significant portion of PAOB's loan balance is
backed by the Hong Kong government's SME Financing Guarantee Scheme and its capital
adequacy ratio was 100%, which was substantially higher than the relevant regulatory
requirement. We believe the business and target customers of PAOB sync well with our existing
operations."
Mr. Gregory Gibb, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Lufax, commented, "During the third quarter, we
doubled down on our goals of further improving efficiency and reinforcing the strategies that
will fuel our future success. While our Puhui loan business faced pressure in generating new
loan sales with asset quality that meets our tightened-up criteria, productivity of our direct sales
team improved by 25.4% quarter over quarter, with 68% of new loans enabled in the third
quarter coming from our direct sales team, compared to 61% in the prior quarter. On the risk
performance front, the C-M3 flow rate of our Puhui business rose from 1.0% to 1.1%
sequentially, due in part to a decrease of 16.1% in the outstanding loan balance of Puhui
portfolios. Our consumer finance business experienced solid growth in new loan sales while
maintaining a healthy asset quality. As the SBO segment faces lingering uncertainty and may
need more time to recover, we plan to continue to grow our consumer finance business. Finally,
we would like to express our ongoing gratitude to our shareholders for their continued support.
We distributed our first half 2023 dividends in October, totaling US$89 million, and will continue
to use our best efforts to deliver value to our shareholders."
Mr. David Choy, Chief Financial Officer of Lufax, commented, "We remained committed to our
cost optimization efforts during the third quarter. Our total expenses decreased by 30.1% from
the same period of the prior year, and despite top-line pressure, we recorded a net profit of
RMB131.0 million for the quarter. In alignment with our emphasis on stability and resilience, our
guarantee subsidiary's leverage ratio was only 1.6x at the end of the quarter, compared to the
regulatory limit of 10x. Meanwhile, our cash at bank amounted to RMB39.8 billion as of
September 30, 2023. We remain confident in our ability to maintain our operational prudence
and generate sustainable growth."

Technology platform-based income was RMB3,259 million (US$447 million) in the third
quarter of 2023, compared to RMB6,672 million in the same period of 2022, representing
a decrease of 51.2%, due to 1) the decrease of retail credit service fees driven by the
decrease in new loan sales and loan balance and 2) the decrease of referral and other
technology platform-based income driven by the decrease in transaction volume.
Net interest income was RMB3,307 million (US$453 million) in the third quarter of 2023,
compared to RMB4,618 million in the same period of 2022, representing a decrease of
28.4%, mainly due to the decrease in loan balance, partly offset by the increase of net
interest income from the Company's consumer finance business.
Guarantee income was RMB941 million (US$129 million) in the third quarter of 2023,
compared to RMB1,863 million in the same period of 2022, representing a decrease of
49.5%, primarily due to the decrease in loan balance and a lower fee rate.
Other income was RMB291 million (US$40 million) in the third quarter of 2023, compared
to other loss of RMB129 million in the same period of 2022. The increase was mainly due
to the low base of the same period last year due to a refund of account management fees
to the Company's primary credit enhancement partner in that period.
Investment income was RMB253 million (US$35 million) in the third quarter of 2023,
compared to RMB168 million in the same period of 2022, mainly due to the decreased
impairment loss of investment assets' fair value compared to the same period of last year.
TOTAL EXPENSES
Total expenses decreased by 30.1% to RMB7,747 million (US$1,062 million) in the third quarter
of 2023 from RMB11,082 million in the same period of 2022. This decrease was mainly driven by
sales and marketing expenses, as sales and marketing expenses decreased by 43.7% to
RMB2,290 million (US$314 million) in the third quarter of 2023 from RMB4,071 million in the
same period of 2022. Total expenses excluding credit impairment losses, asset impairment
losses, finance costs and other (gains)/losses decreased by 31.1% to RMB4,650 million (US$637
million) in the third quarter of 2023 from RMB6,746 million in the same period of 2022.

Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 43.7% to RMB2,290 million (US$314 million)
in the third quarter of 2023 from RMB4,071 million in the same period of 2022. The
decrease was mainly due to 1) the decreased borrowers acquisition costs as a result of the
decrease in new loan sales and 2) decreased investor acquisition and retention expenses
and referral expenses from platform service attributable to the decreased transaction
volume.
General and administrative expenses decreased by 15.6% to RMB500 million (US$69
million) in the third quarter of 2023 from RMB592 million in the same period of 2022,
mainly due to the Company's expense control measures and the decrease of tax and
surcharge.
Operation and servicing expenses decreased by 7.6% to RMB1,478 million (US$203
million) in the third quarter of 2023 from RMB1,600 million in the same period of 2022,
due to the Company's expense control measures and decrease of loan balance, partially
offset by increasing resources invested in collection services.
Technology and analytics expenses decreased by 21.0% to RMB382 million (US$52
million) in the third quarter of 2023 from RMB484 million in the same period of 2022 due
to 1) the optimization of technology and the research team, and 2) the Company's
improved efficiency.
Credit impairment losses decreased by 24.1% to RMB3,001 million (US$411 million) in the
third quarter of 2023 from RMB3,956 million in the same period of 2022, mainly due to
the decrease in provision of loans and receivables as a result of the decreased loan
balance.
Finance costs decreased by 86.9% to RMB40 million (US$5 million) in the third quarter of
2023 from RMB306 million in the same period of 2022, mainly due to the increase of
interest income from bank deposits and the decrease of interest as a result of our early
repayment of our Ping An Convertible Promissory Notes and other dollar debt.
Other losses increased to RMB56 million (US$8 million) in the third quarter of 2023 from
RMB7 million in the same period of 2022, mainly due to the decrease of government
subsidies, partially offset by the decrease in foreign exchange losses.
NET PROFIT
Net profit was RMB131 million (US$18 million) in the third quarter of 2023, compared to
RMB1,355 million in the same period of 2022, as a result of the aforementioned factors.
EARNINGS PER ADS
Basic and diluted earnings per American Depositary Share ("ADS") were both RMB0.04
(US$0.01) in the third quarter of 2023. Each two ADSs represents one ordinary share ("Share").

2023, as compared to RMB43,882 million as of December 31, 2022. Net assets of the Company
