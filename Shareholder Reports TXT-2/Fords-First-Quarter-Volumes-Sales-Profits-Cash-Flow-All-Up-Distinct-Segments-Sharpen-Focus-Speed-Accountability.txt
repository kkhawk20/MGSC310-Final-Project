Ford’s First-Quarter Volumes, Sales, Profits, Cash Flow All Up;
Distinct Segments Sharpen Focus, Speed, Accountability
• Three customer-focused businesses now drive value, growth: Ford Blue (iconic gas, hybrid
vehicles), Ford Model e (breakthrough EVs), Ford Pro (commercial products, services)
• Quarterly revenue rises 20% year-over-year to $41.5 billion; $1.8 billion in net income
compares to year-ago net loss of $3.1 billion; adjusted EBIT of $3.4 billion was 45% higher
• Ford Pro EBIT nearly triples, to $1.4 billion, and Ford Blue EBIT doubles, to $2.6 billion, with
margins for both exceeding 10%
• Company reaffirms guidance for full-year 2023 adjusted EBIT of $9 billion to $11 billion,
adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion
DEARBORN, Mich., May 2, 2023 – According to Ford CEO Jim Farley, the first quarter of
organizing around and running the company on behalf of distinct customer groups produced
solid operating results and a glimpse of the promise of its Ford+ growth plan.
“We’re bringing Ford+ to life by zeroing in on what distinct customers need and value the most,”
said Farley. “Ford Pro is leading the way on profitable growth, our big investments in iconic
Ford Blue vehicles and derivatives are winning with customers, and Ford Model e’s different
approach to EVs is significantly reducing costs on our first high-volume products while rapidly
developing breakthrough next-generation vehicles from the ground up.”
Company Key Metrics Summary
1
Ford’s first-quarter 2023 revenue reached $41.5 billion, up 20% from the same period a year
ago, on shipments approaching 1.1 million vehicles, a 9% increase.
Customers made Ford America’s best-selling vehicle brand in the quarter, choosing its iconic
gas-powered, hybrid and electric trucks, commercial vans and SUVs – categories in which the
company has demonstrated strengths and made strategic commitments.
Profitability in the quarter was enhanced by a favorable mix of products, higher net pricing and
increased volume and was broadly based geographically. The Ford Blue and Ford Pro
business segments were both profitable in every region where they operate.
Net income of $1.8 billion compared to a net loss in the 2022 period that was primarily
attributable to a change in the mark-to-market value of the company’s investment in Rivian.
Company adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $3.4 billion, an increase of
45% and margin of 8.1%.
Cash flow from operations in Q1 was $2.8 billion; Ford generated $693 million in adjusted free
cash flow. They enabled continued strategic investments in profitable growth and returns to
shareholders, including through a regular dividend payable June 1.
At the end of the quarter, the company’s persistently strong balance sheet had nearly $29 billion
in cash and more than $46 billion in liquidity. In addition, Ford recently completed the renewal
of its more than $17 billion in sustainability-linked corporate credit facilities.
Business Segment Highlights
Ford Blue – which has high expectations for profitable growth from its portfolio of iconic gas-
powered and hybrid vehicles – had first-quarter revenue of $25.1 billion, EBIT of $2.6 billion and
an EBIT margin of 10.4%, all up sharply from a year ago.
Already the maker of America’s most popular truck for 46 straight years – and top vehicle of any
type in the region for 41 years – Ford Blue’s Maverick and Bronco were recognized by Car and
Driver among its latest 10 best trucks and SUVs. Mustang was recently named the world’s
best-selling sports car over the past 10 years combined, with the seventh-generation, 2024
2
model coming soon. The segment is also launching new versions of the Ford Escape and
Lincoln Corsair SUVs.
Ford Model e, which operates like a startup, is rapidly developing innovative electric vehicles
along with breakthrough digital capabilities for deployment across the company’s entire product
line. Quarterly shipments of and revenue from EVs were limited by production interruptions of
two highly popular vehicles: the Mustang Mach-E SUV, to make industrial changes that will
nearly double manufacturing capacity, and the F-150 Lightning pickup, to isolate and address a
battery issue before it became a problem for customers.
In March, Ford introduced the new, all-electric Explorer crossover that will be built and sold in
Europe – another step toward making and selling EVs at a global run rate of 600,000 units by
the end of 2023 and more than two million by the end of 2026.
Disciplined capital investments are boosting capacity of popular EVs like the Mustang Mach-E,
F-150 Lightning and E-Transit. Additionally, Ford Model e will manufacture its next-generation
electric pickup at the BlueOval City mega-campus now rising in Stanton, Tenn.; transform an
existing operation in Oakville, Ont., Canada, to produce batteries and next-generation EVs; and
construct and staff an LFP battery plant in Marshall, Mich.
Meanwhile, Ford Pro, which helps commercial customers transform their enterprises with
tailored gas, hybrid and electric vehicles and high-value services, posted 18% growth in
wholesales; 28% higher revenue, to $13.2 billion; EBIT of $1.4 billion, nearly three times the
2022 level; and an EBIT margin of 10.3%.
The foundation for Ford Pro’s growth ambitions is made up of market leadership, scale and
customer knowledge. Ford’s Transit and E-Transit together remain the top commercial van in
both North America and Europe. Nine of the vehicles it sells, including Transit, E-Transit and
Super Duty pickups – more than from any automaker – recently earned “Vincentric Best Fleet
Value in America” awards.
On top of that substantial base, Ford Pro is layering an ecosystem of software, services and EV
charging. Paid software subscriptions increased 64% year-over-year in the first quarter and
higher-revenue services were also up strongly. The numbers of mobile repair orders from
commercial customers and vans now on the road delivering related services to them both more
than doubled from a year ago.
As anticipated, Ford Credit’s earnings before taxes of $303 million were down from last year as
a result of a lower financing margin, increased credit losses and a decline in leasing income.
The company’s credit-loss performance remains strong and below its historical average, but is
trending upward toward more normal levels. Likewise, auction values are also still strong,
though down from their peak in the first half of 2022.
Outlook
Ford is maintaining the full-year 2023 performance expectations that the company first
articulated in early February: for adjusted EBIT of $9 billion to $11 billion and adjusted free
cash flow of about $6 billion.
Additionally, the company reaffirmed 2023 segment-level EBIT expectations: about
$7 billion for Ford Blue, up modestly from last year; a full-year loss of about $3 billion for
Ford Model e; and EBIT approaching $6 billion for Ford Pro, which would be nearly twice its
2022 earnings.
3
Ford’s operating targets presume a range of puts and takes:
• Headwinds including economic uncertainty around the globe; higher industrywide
customer incentives, as vehicle supply-and-demand rebalances; a lower profit from Ford
Credit; lower past service pension income; exchange rates; and growth-related
investments, e.g., in customer experience, connected services and capital expenditures,
and
• Tailwinds such as supply chain improvements and higher industry volumes; launch of
the all-new Super Duty truck; and lower costs of goods sold, including for materials and
commodities.
Ford will host its next capital markets event here on May 21 and 22, during which it will update
investors, analysts and others on the Ford+ strategy, including key performance indicators and
financial targets for each of the business segments. The company plans to report its second-
quarter 2023 financial results on Thursday, July 27.

manganese, can disrupt Ford’s production of vehicles;
• To facilitate access to the raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford
has entered into, and expects to continue to enter into, multi-year commitments to raw material
suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such materials as well
as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast;
• Ford’s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+;
• Ford’s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in delays in new model launches, recall
campaigns, or increased warranty costs;
• Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint

market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the
automotive and digital and software services industries and its reputation may be harmed if it is
unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced;
• Ford’s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United
States;
• With a global footprint, Ford’s results could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical
developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events;
• Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, or
significant geopolitical event;
6
• Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting
from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors;
• Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange
rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit’s investments, including marketable
securities, can have a significant effect on results;
• Ford and Ford Credit’s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at
competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market
volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors;
• The impact of government incentives on Ford’s business could be significant, and Ford’s receipt
of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback;

data use, and data protection laws and regulations as well as consumers’ heightened
expectations to safeguard their personal information; and
• Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection
regulations, or other regulations.
We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking
statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may
be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of

Non-GAAP Financial Measures That Supplement GAAP Measures
We use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and
segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental
information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these
non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-
period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial
performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used
by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.
• Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net income / (Loss) attributable to Ford) – Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP
measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves
comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results
of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Pre-tax special items
consist of (i) pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses, (ii) gains and losses on investments in equity securities, (iii)
significant personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to
match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix, and (iv) other items that we do not
necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted
EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special
items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and
OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities.
• Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income / (Loss) Margin) – Company
Adjusted EBIT Margin is Company Adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to
management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting.
• Adjusted Earnings / (Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings / (Loss) Per Share) – Measure of
Company’s diluted net earnings / (loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special
items and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate
performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide
guidance for adjusted earnings / (loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings / (loss) per share basis because
the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with
reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.
• Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) – Measure of Company’s tax rate
excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which
investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we
do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special
items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and
OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.
• Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (FCF) (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By / (Used In)
Operating Activities) – Measure of Company’s operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit’s operating cash flows. The measure
contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford
Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension
contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under GAAP. This measure is
useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management’s assessment of the Company’s operating cash
flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company Adjusted FCF, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by
/ (used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with
reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain
commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special
items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net
cash provided by / (used in) our operating activities.
• Adjusted ROIC – Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax from the last four quarters, divided
by the average invested capital over the last four quarters.
This calculation provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company’s after-cash tax operating
return on its invested capital for the period presented.
Adjusted net operating profit / (loss) after-cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford
Credit Debt), and certain pension / OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt
(excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension / OPEB liability.
Note: Calculated results may not sum due to rounding
